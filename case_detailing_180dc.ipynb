Certain intervenors also preferred an application in support of the appeal, seeking\\nclear directions to all Courts to refrain from imposing ƒirrelevant, freaky or illegal bail conditions□.\\n2. Ibsen, the prescient nineteenth century author, made a powerful statement (quoted as the\\nepigram at the beginning of this judgment); sadly, even today, in the twenty first century, after 70\\nyears as a republic with the goal of equality for all, many courts seem to be oblivious of the problem.\\nIn a sense, this judgment is not as much about only the merits of the impugned conditions of the\\nbail order, but is meant to address a wider canvas of (what appears to be) entrenched paternalistic\\nand misogynistic attitudes that are regrettably reflected at times in judicial orders and judgments.\\n3. The brief facts of the case are that on 20.04.2020 at about 2.30 a.m., the accused-applicant, a\\nneighbour of the complainant, entered her house and caught hold of the complainant„s hand, and\\nallegedly attempted to harass her sexually. Accordingly, Crime No. 133/2020 was registered at\\nPolice Station, Bhatpachlana, District-Ujjain for the offences punishable under sections 452, 354A3,\\n323 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The case was investigated and a charge sheet was filed.\\nThe accused filed an application under Section 438 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereafter\\nƒCrPC□) seeking pre-arrest bail. The High Court, by the impugned 3Section 354A reads as follows:\\nƒ354A.

The appellants cite Kunal Kumar Tiwari v. State of Bihar4 and Sumit Mehta v. State (NCT of\\nDelhi)5 and argue that this court„s observations in those decisions must be followed by every court\\nwhile considering and dealing with bail applications. They also rely on the observations made in\\npara 18 of State of M.P v. Madanlal,6 and urge that in cases of sexual offences, the idea of\\ncompromise, especially in the form of marriage between the accused and the prosecutrix is\\nabhorrent, and should not be considered a judicial remedy, as it would be antithetical to the\\nwoman„s honour and dignity. Likewise, reliance was placed on Ramphal v. State of Haryana7, where\\nthe 4 (2018) 16 SCC 74 5 (2013) 15 SCC 570 6 (2015) 7 SCC 681 7Crl. A.

The appellants brought to the notice of this Court, various decisions and orders where the\\nobservations made by the judges in offences against women including cases under the Protection of\\nChildren from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO) were extraneous. The appellants submitted that\\nthe courts, in many cases, especially under the POCSO Act, granted bail on the plea that an\\nagreement to marry had been reached between the accused and prosecutrix. Additionally, they also\\nsubmitted that while adjudicating matters of sexual harassment and rape, judges have made\\nshocking remarks on the character of the prosecutrix.\\n7. Reference is made to Ravi Jatav v. State of M.P8, where the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, while\\ngranting bail (to an accused of committing offences under Sections 376-D, 366, 506, 34 IPC)\\nimposed conditions that the accused ƒshall register himself as a Covid-19 Warrior□ and was to be\\nassigned work of Covid-19 disaster management at the discretion of the District Magistrate.

The appellants also cite Mohan v.

Counsel for the Intervenors submitted that under sections 437(2) and 438, the power to impose\\nconditions have been expressed in very wide terms by using the phrase ƒany condition.□ Recently,\\nHigh Courts while granting bail under these sections have started imposing irrelevant conditions.\\nThe Intervenors have annexed around twenty-three orders in which such conditions for bail were\\nimposed. They argue that the conditions that can be imposed under the law are clearly laid down by\\nthe Supreme Court in the case of Munish Bhasin v. State16 and reiterated in Parvez Noordin\\nLokhandwalla v. State of Maharashtra.17 Accordingly, it is clear that imposing conditions like\\nrendering community service in COVID hospitals or in any other institution, plantation of trees,\\ncontributing to any particular charity relief fund, etc. is impermissible in law. The Intervenors\\nfurther submit that the accused, during pendency of the trial are presumed innocent and their guilt\\nis as yet to be adjudicated by the Court. Imposition of conditions like compulsive community\\nservice, etc. is violative of the right to equality and personal liberty, including procedure established\\nby law in the Indian Constitution.\\n13. The Intervenors also submit that the Court while deciding a bail application, cannot assume the\\nrole of a social reformer or fund raiser for charities and impose 15Cr. M. No. 23962/2017, order\\ndated 13.09.2017 passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court 16(2009) 4 SCC 45 17(2020) 10\\nSCC 77 conditions which have no nexus with the offense or relevance with the object of the bail\\nprovisions.\\n14. It was submitted that in IA No. 102226/2020, the appellants have brought to the notice of this\\nCourt, several other instances in which similar directions have been made by High Courts and Trial\\nCourts across the country. Such wide prevalence necessitates the urgent intervention of this Court to\\nfirstly, declare that such remarks are unacceptable and have the potential to cause grave harm to the\\nprosecutrix and the society at large, secondly, reiterate that judicial orders have to conform to\\ncertain judicial standards, and thirdly, take necessary steps to ensure that this does not happen in\\nthe future.\\n15. It was further submitted that this Court should intervene and issue directions or guidelines on\\nbail and anticipatory bail to ensure that courts impose only those conditions as are permissible in\\nlaw. Further, this Court was urged to issue directions on gender sensitization of the bar and the\\nbench, particularly with regard to judicial empathy for the prosecutrix.\\n16. The learned Attorney General, who had been issued notice in this matter, made his submissions\\nin support of the appeal; he also filed a detailed note suggesting the steps that should be taken to\\nsensitize all stakeholders, especially courts, while dealing with offences against women.

State19, the learned Attorney General submitted that while relying upon the\\nobservations made in the above-mentioned cases, the court may highlight that in cases of crimes\\nagainst women, the following additional considerations may be kept in mind:\\ni. Bail conditions should not mandate or even permit contact between the accused\\nand the victim.\\n18 (1996) 2 SCC 384 19 (2004) 5 SCC 518 ii. Bail conditions must seek to protect the\\ncomplainant from any harassment by the accused.\\niii.

Wherever bail is granted, the complainant may immediately be informed that the accused has\\nbeen granted bail.\\nv. Bail conditions must be free from stereotypical or patriarchal notions on women and their place in\\nsociety, and must strictly be in accordance with the requirements of the CrPC.\\nvi. The Courts while adjudicating a case, should not suggest or entertain any notions (or encourage\\nany step) towards compromises between the prosecutrix and the accused to get married, as it is\\nbeyond their powers and jurisdiction.\\n17. On gender equality and gender sensitization, the Attorney General argued that to achieve the\\ngoal of gender justice, it is imperative that judicial officers, judges, and members of the bar are made\\naware of gender prejudices that hinder justice. Accordingly, he submitted that the foremost aspect to\\nfacilitate a gender sensitive approach, is to train judges to exercise their discretion and avoid the use\\nof gender- based stereotypes while deciding cases pertaining to sexual offences. Secondly, judges\\nshould have sensitivity to the concerns of the survivor of sexual offences.\\n18. Reliance was placed on the Bangkok General Guidance for Judges on Applying a Gender\\nPerspective in South East Asia, by the International Commission of Jurists. It was pointed out that\\nthe following stereotypes are often encountered in the course of judicial decision-making and should\\nbe avoided: -\\ni. Women are physically weak;\\nii.

He emphasized that any directions towards gender sensitization\\nshould include judges of all levels of the judiciary. Further, the counsel urged that courses on gender\\nsensitization should be included in the curriculum of law schools, and the All-India Bar Exam\\nshould include questions on gender sensitization as well. In addition to this, he recommended that a\\ndetailed curriculum may be prepared with the help of subject matter experts by each High Court, to\\nbe a part of the syllabus for the Judicial Services Exams and training for inducted judges.\\nNature of the beast20: the problem\\n20. Women often experience obstacles in gaining access to mechanisms of redress, including legal\\naid, counselling services and shelters. They are re-victimized and exposed to further risk of violence\\nthrough the denial of redress in the context of informal trials or negotiations between families and\\ncommunity leaders. The payment of financial compensation by the perpetrator or his family for acts\\nof violence against women, in lieu of legal remedies, was a recurrent concern vis-†-vis the formal\\nand informal justice systems. Violence against women in India is systematic and occurs in 20 A\\nphrase that means the traits inherent to a thing or situation, especially a negative or difficult one\\n(See https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/the+nature+of+the+beast) the public and private\\nspheres. It is underpinned by the persistence of patriarchal social norms and inter- and intra-gender\\nhierarchies. Women are discriminated against and subordinated not only on the basis of sex, but on\\nother grounds too, such as caste, class, ability, sexual orientation, tradition and other realities.21\\n21. Gender violence is most often unseen and is shrouded in a culture of silence. The causes and\\nfactors of violence against women include entrenched unequal power equations between men and\\nwomen that foster violence and its acceptability, aggravated by cultural and social norms, economic\\ndependence, poverty and alcohol consumption, etc. In India, the culprits are often known to the\\nwoman; the social and economic \"costs\" of reporting such crimes are high.

In The Standard of Social Justice as a Research Process 25 two scholars of psychology made a\\nstrong indictment of the (contextually, Canadian) criminal justice process:\\nƒThe more general indictment of the current criminal justice process is that the law\\nand legal doctrines concerning sexual assault have acted as the principle [sic]\\nsystemic mechanisms for invalidating the experiences of women and children. Given\\nthis state of affairs, the traditional view of the legal system as neutral, objective and\\ngender- blind is not defensible. Since the system is ineffective in protecting the rights\\nof women and children, it is necessary to re-examine the existing doctrines which\\nreflect the cultural and social limitations that have preserved dominant male\\ninterests at the expense of women and children.□ Previous rulings\\n26.

In Sumit Mehta v. State (NCT of Delhi) (supra) this court, with respect to the conditions that can\\nbe imposed validly under section 438(2) of the CrPC, observed that:\\nƒ11.

Alksnis and L. Park at p. 100 personal freedom and the right of\\ninvestigation of the police. For the same, while granting relief Under Section 438(1),\\nappropriate conditions can be imposed Under Section 438(2) so as to ensure an\\nuninterrupted investigation. The object of putting such conditions should be to avoid\\nthe possibility of the person hampering the investigation. Thus, any condition, which\\nhas no reference to the fairness or propriety of the investigation or trial, cannot be\\ncountenanced as permissible under the law. So, the discretion of the Court while\\nimposing conditions must be exercised with utmost restraint.□\\n28. It was urged that the observations made in Kunal Kumar and Sumit Mehta ought to be followed\\nwhile imposing bail conditions. The appellants relying upon the observations made in para 18 of\\nState of M.P v. Madanlal,26 submit that in cases of sexual offences, the concept of compromise,\\nespecially in the form of marriage between the accused and the prosecutrix shall not be thought of,\\nas any such attempt would be offensive to the woman„s dignity.\\nƒ18. €We would like to clearly state that in a case of rape or attempt of rape, the conception of\\ncompromise under no circumstances can really be thought of. These are crimes against the body of a\\nwoman which is her own temple. These are offences which suffocate the breath of life and sully the\\nreputation. And reputation, needless to emphasise, is the richest jewel one can conceive of in life. No\\none would allow it to be extinguished. When a human frame is defiled, the ƒpurest treasure□, is lost.\\nDignity of a woman is a part of her non- perishable and immortal self and no one should ever think\\nof painting it in clay.

However, it is imperative to emphasize that we do not accept such\\ncompromise in matters relating to the offence of rape and similar cases of sexual assault. Hence, the\\naforesaid compromise is of no relevance in deciding this matter. On merits, we do not find any\\nground to interfere in as much as the evidence of the prosecutrix is coupled with the medical\\nevidence which clearly proves that the offence of rape has been committed. Therefore, the Trial\\nCourt and the High Court have rightly convicted the accused/appellants.□\\n30. Empirically, the statistics regarding certain kinds of crimes against women have not shown any\\nsignificant decline. In states and union territories, 32033 rape cases (under Section 376 IPC) were\\nregistered in 2019; 4038 cases of attempt to rape were registered the same year (under Section 376\\nread with Section 511, IPC). As many as 88,387 cases under Section 354 IPC were registered the\\nsame year, whereas 6939 cases were registered under Section 509 (outraging the modesty of a\\nwoman) in 2019. In all, a total of 4, 05,861 crimes against women were reported in 2019 (as against\\n359849 in 2017 and 378236 in 2018). The statistic for a relatively new species of offensive activities,\\ncybercrimes that are women-centric, such as Transmitting of Sexually Explicit Material (Sec.\\n67A/67B, Information Technology Act), Blackmailing Defamation/Morphing/creating Fake Profile\\netc) registered in 2019, were 1645. POCSO offences, where girl children were victims, reported in\\n2019 were 46,005.28 The role of the courts and law enforcement agencies as neutral authorities,\\nunder a duty to ensure fairness\\n28https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/CII%202019%20Volume%201.pdf\\n31. The role of all courts is to make sure that the survivor can rely on their impartiality and\\nneutrality, at every stage in a criminal proceeding, where she is the survivor and an aggrieved party.\\nEven an indirect undermining of this responsibility cast upon the court, by permitting discursive\\nformations on behalf of the accused, that seek to diminish his agency, or underplay his role as an\\nactive participant (or perpetrator) of the crime, could in many cases, shake the confidence of the\\nrape survivor (or accuser of the crime) in the impartiality of the court. The current attitude\\nregarding crimes against women typically is that ƒgrave□ offences like rape are not tolerable and\\noffenders must be punished. This, however, only takes into consideration rape and other serious\\nforms of gender-based physical violence. The challenges Indian women face are formidable: they\\ninclude a misogynistic society with entrenched cultural values and beliefs, bias (often\\nsub-conscious) about the stereotypical role of women, social and political structures that are heavily\\nmale- centric, most often legal enforcement structures that either cannot cope with, or are unwilling\\nto take strict and timely measures. Therefore, reinforcement of this stereotype, in court utterances\\nor orders, through considerations which are extraneous to the case, would impact fairness.\\n32. Academic writings highlight that a judgment at all levels has a number of distinct audiences,\\neach of which engages with it in a different way. The parties to the case and their counsel will be\\ninterested in how the judge resolves their specific dispute - what the law gives to or requires of them.\\nAt the same time, in a legal system where judgments of courts set precedents, and in particular\\nwithin a common law system, judgments have significance beyond their authoritative resolution of a\\nspecific dispute…particularly in the Supreme Court. Thus, the judge is not only communicating to\\nthe parties their rights and liabilities in the context of the specific dispute being litigated; the judge\\nis also addressing the broader legal community… other lawyers, judges, legal academics, lawAparna Bhat vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 18 March, 2021\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13024806/ 11'),\n",

Using rakhi tying as a condition for bail, transforms a molester into a brother, by a judicial\\nmandate. This is wholly unacceptable, and has the effect of diluting and eroding the offence of\\nsexual harassment. The act perpetrated on the survivor constitutes an offence in law, and is not a\\nminor transgression that can be remedied by way of an apology, rendering community service, tying\\na rakhi or presenting a gift to the survivor, or even promising to marry her, as the case may be. The\\nlaw criminalizes outraging the modesty of a woman. Granting bail, subject to such conditions,\\nrenders the court susceptible to the charge of re-negotiating and mediating justice between\\nconfronting parties in a criminal offence and perpetuating gender stereotypes.\\n34. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has noted that judicial stereotyping ƒis a\\ncommon and pernicious barrier to justice, particularly for women victims and survivors of violence.\\nSuch stereotyping causes judges to reach a view about cases based on preconceived beliefs, rather\\nthan relevant facts and actual enquiry.□30 Furthering of rape myths and stereotypes by the\\njudiciary, limits the emancipatory potential of the law.\\n35. ˆJudicial stereotyping„ refers to the practice of judges ascribing to an individual specific\\nattributes, characteristics or roles by reason only of her or his membership in a particular social\\ngroup (e.g. women). It is used, also, to refer to the practice of judges perpetuating harmful\\nstereotypes through their failure to challenge them, for example by lower courts or parties to legal\\nproceedings.31 Stereotyping 29Erica Rackley, The Art and Craft of Writing Judgements in Hunter,\\nRosemary and McGlynn, Clare and Rackley, Erika, eds.

Judges can play a significant role in ridding the justice system of harmful stereotypes. They have\\nan important responsibility to base their decisions on law and facts in evidence, and not engage in\\ngender stereotyping. This requires judges to identify gender stereotyping, and identify how the\\napplication, enforcement or perpetuation of these stereotypes discriminates against women or\\ndenies them equal access to justice. Stereotyping might compromise the impartiality of a judge„s\\ndecision and affect his or her views about witness credibility or the culpability of the accused\\nperson.36As a judge of the Canadian Supreme Court remarked:\\nƒMyths and stereotypes are a form of bias because they impair the individual judge„s\\nability to assess the facts in a particular case in an open-minded fashion. In fact,\\njudging based on myths and stereotypes is entirely incompatible with keeping an\\nopen mind, because myths 32Supra, p. 17.\\n33The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women\\n(CEDAW), was adopted in 1979 by the UN General Assembly; it is sometimes\\ndescribed as an international bill of rights for women.

This Court therefore holds that the use of reasoning/language which diminishes the offence and\\ntends to trivialize the survivor, is especially to be avoided under all circumstances. Thus, the\\nfollowing conduct, actions or situations are hereby deemed irrelevant, e.g. - to say that the survivor\\nhad in the past consented to such or similar acts or that she behaved promiscuously, or by her acts\\nor clothing, provoked the alleged action of the accused, that she behaved in a manner unbecoming of\\nchaste or 40State of Punjab v.

Similarly, imposing conditions that implicitly tend to condone or diminish the harm caused\\nby the accused and have the effect of potentially exposing the survivor to secondary trauma, such as\\nmandating mediation processes in non-compoundable offences, mandating as part of bail\\nconditions, community service (in a manner of speaking with the so-called reformative approach\\ntowards the perpetrator of sexual offence) or requiring tendering of apology once or repeatedly, or in\\nany manner getting or being in touch with the survivor, is especially forbidden. The law does not\\npermit or countenance such conduct, where the survivor can potentially be traumatized many times\\nover or be led into some kind of non-voluntary acceptance, or be compelled by the circumstances to\\naccept and condone behavior what is a serious offence.\\n43. The instances spelt out in the present judgment are only illustrations; the idea is that the\\ngreatest extent of sensitivity is to be displayed in the judicial approach, language and reasoning\\nadopted by the judge.

There is specific allegation that the representation was made by the\\nofficers of the Bank with regard to the existence of stock worth Rs. 17.50 crores for hypothecation to\\nthe Bank and credit facility was granted to the tune of Rs. 17.50 crores on the belief of due\\nhypothecation of stock. There is also allegation in FIR that stock worth Rs.12 crores had been\\nfraudulently or dishonestly used or disposed of without any payment to the Bank. Such allegations\\nconstitute ingredients of cheating, causing damage to the Bank which was induced because of false\\nstatement made by DAIL and its officials. Mr. Tulsi has submitted that entrustment of physical\\npossession of the property is not essential for the offence defined in Section 405 IPC. The expression\\n\"whoever being in any manner entrusted with property or with any dominion over property\", clearly\\nnegatives the contention that since physical possession was not exclusively transferred to the Bank,\\nthere can not be a case of entrustment. If the offence under Section 405 IPC is interpreted in the\\naforesaid manner, it will open the flood gate for Bank frauds, corruption amongst public servants\\nand will endanger the smooth flow of trade and commerce.

This is not the same thing as having the authority, as a public servant\\nto get the control or dominion over property annexed with an obligation. The\\ngravamen of the offence is the dishonest misappropriation of the money or property\\nwhich comes into the possession or under the control of a public servant who has the\\nostensible authority to receive it even though, technically speaking, form the point of\\nview of view of the distribution of departmental duties under internal rules of an\\noffence, it may not be within the scope of his authority or duty to accept the money.\\nThe fact that a public servant acts fraudulently in the exercise of his duties as a public\\nservant to get dominion or control over some property will be an aggravating and not\\nan exculpating circumstance.

What value to be attached to the allegations made in the FIR is to be\\nexamined at trial when on the basis of FIR charge sheet will be framed. It is not the\\nduty of the High Court to embark upon appreciation of evidence in quashing the\\nproceedings. In support of this contention, Mr. Tulsi has relied in the decisions of this\\nCourt in State of Haryana Vs. Bhajan Lal (1992) (1) SCC 335), State of Bihar Vs.

Hence, the same are not liable to be quashed even\\nbefore completing the investigations.\\nMr. Tulsi has also submitted that a particular act may constitute booth civil wrong as\\nwell as criminal wrong but merely because civil action is also pursued, such course of\\naction does not render criminal action impermissible. It has been contended by Mr.\\nTulsi that since the very definition of offence of criminal breach of trust is founded on\\nlegal contract touching upon the discharge of trust, almost every case of criminal\\nbreach of trust is bound to have an element of civil liability. Policy of the legislature\\nin enacting the offence under Section 405 IPC, therefore, is to treat the breach of\\ncontract in the matter of property which is entrusted as an aggravated civil wrong and\\nthereby constituting a criminal offence. That being the policy, to quash a FIR on the\\nground that a civil remedy has already been invoked would be destructive of the\\nobject of the legislation. In this connection, Mr. Tulsi has relied on the decision of\\nthis Court in Collector of Customs and Central Excise, Bhubneshwar, District Puri Vs.\\nParadip Port Trust and Another (1990 (4) SCC 205).

In the said\\ncase, the FIR of 1984 was quashed by the Court in 1986 but nine years, the decision of\\nthe High Court was set aside and it was directed that the investigation should\\nrecommence.

In\\nsuch circumstances, it will be only proper that the CBI should be permitted to\\ncontinue with further investigations and on the face of the allegations in the FIRs\\nwhich clearly constitute offences against the accused, there was no reason to quash\\nthe FIRs and thereby stopping the investigation at the threshold.

Further in June/July 1985 fresh hypothecation documents were executed by\\nthe New Tobacco Company Limited and a memorandum of satisfaction of charge was\\nfiled by the Bank in respect of DAIL to the Registrar of Companies. The necessary\\ndocuments were also filed by the Bank with the Registrar evidencing the charge\\ncreated in favour of New Tobacco Company Limited.\\nMr. Shanti Bhushan has also submitted that the allegation in the FIR that the opinion\\nof Shri S.K.Ghosh, Chief Officer (Legal) of the United Bank of India to the effect that\\nthe bank would not be in a position to enforce its right in respect of the transferor\\nCompany was erroneous and designedly made, is also incorrect and without any\\nbasis.

The grant of credit facility giving of a loan in pursuance of\\nthat credit facility cannot possibly amount to entrustment of property. A loan is quite\\ndifferent form entrustment of money. Similarly, when the debtor hypothecates his\\ngoods to Bank by way of security, there is no entrustment of those goods to the bank\\nby the debtor. Even if there is any contravention of the terms of the contract under\\nwhich credit facilities are given, it will be merely a breach of contract for which the\\nBank may made debtor liable for damages under the civil law. There will be no\\noccasion for committing any offence of criminal breach of trust. In support of this\\ncontention, Mr Shanti Bhushan has relied on the decision of this Court in Velji\\nRaghavji Patel Vs. State of Maharashtra (1965 (2) SCR 429). It has been held in the\\nsaid decision that in order to establish entrustment of dominion over property to an\\naccused person, the mere existence of that person's dominion over property is not\\nenough. It must be further shown that his dominion was the result must be further\\nshown that his dominion was the result of entrustment.\\nMr. Shanti Bhushan has also referred to a decision of this Court in State of Gujarat\\nVs. Jaswantlal Natha lal (1968 (2) SCR 408). In the said decision it has been\\nindicated that the term ' entrusted' found in Section 405 IPC Governs not only the\\nwords with the property immediately following it but also the words with the\\nproperty immediately following it but also the words or 'with any dominion over the\\nproperty' occurring thereafter. Before there can be any entrustment, the entrustment\\ncarries with it the implication that the person handing over any property or on whose\\nbehalf that property is handed over to another, continues to be its owner. A mere\\ntransaction of sale cannot amount to an entrustment. It has been observed in the said\\ndecision that although the government had sold the cement in question to BSS solely\\nfor the purpose of being used in connection with the construction work referred to\\nearlier, that circumstance does not make the transaction in question anything other\\nthan a sale, After delivery of the cement, the government has neither any right not\\ndominion over it, It the purchaser had failed to comply with the requirements of any\\nlaw relating to cement control, he should have been prosecuted for the same, But the\\ncourt was unable to hold that there was any breach of trust.\\nComing to the question of offences under Sections 467, 468 and 471 IPC Mr. Shanti\\nBhushan has also submitted that no offence under the aforesaid Sections even prima\\nfacie, has been committed even on the face value of the Allegations in the FIR.

For\\nquashing the complaint by way of action at the threshold. It is, therefore, necessary to consider\\nwhether no the face of the allegations, a criminal offence is constituted or not. In recent decisions of\\nthis Court, the case of Bhajan Lal (supra), since relied on by Mr. Tulsi, the guiding principles in\\nquashing a criminal case have been indicated.\\nIn the instant case, a serious dispute has been raised by the learned counsel appearing for the\\nrespective party as to whether on the face of the allegations, an offence of criminal breach of trust is\\nconstituted or not. In our view, the expression 'entrusted with property' or 'with any dominion over\\nproperty' has been used in wide sense in Section 405 I.P.C. Such expression includes all case in\\nwhich goods are entrusted, that is, voluntarily handed over for a specific purpose and dishonestly\\ndisposed of in violation of law or in violation of contract. The expression 'entrusted appearing in\\nSection 405 I.P.C. is not necessarily a term of law. It has wide and different implication in different\\ncontext. It is, however, necessary that the ownership or beneficial interest in the ownership of the\\nproperty entrusted in respect of which offence is alleged to have been committed must be in some\\nperson other than the accused and the latter must hold it on account of some person or in some way\\nfor his benefit. The expression 'Trust' in Section 405 I.P.C. is a comprehensive expression and has\\nbeen used to denote various kinds of relationship like the relationship of trustee and beneficiary,\\nbailer and bailee, master and servant, pledger and pledger. When some goods are hypothecated by a\\nperson to another person. the ownership of the goods still remains with the person who has\\nhypothecated such goods. The property in respect of which criminal breach of trust can be\\ncommitted must necessarily be the property of some person other than the accused or the beneficial\\ninterest in or ownership of it must be in other person and the offender must hold such property in\\ntrust for such other person or for his benefit. In a case of pledge, the pledged article belongs to some\\nother person or for his benefit. In a case of Pledge, the pledged article belongs to some other person\\nbut the same is kept in trust by the pledgee. In the instant case, a floating charge was made on the\\ngoods by way of security to cover up credit facility. In our view, in such case for disposing of the\\ngoods covering the security to cover up credit facility. In our view, In such case for disposing of the\\ngoods covering the security to cover up credit facility. In our view, in such case for disposing of the\\ngoods covering the security against credit facility the offence of criminal breach of trust is not\\ncommitted. In the facts and circumstances of the case, it, however, appears to us that the\\nRespondents moved the High Court only in 1991 although the first Fir was filed in 1987 and the\\nsecond was filed in 1989. The CBI, therefore, Got sufficient time to complete the investigation for\\nthe purpose of framing the charge.\\nAlthough Mr. Tulsi, the learned Additional Solicitor General, is justified in his submission that a\\nparticular act may constitute both civil wrong as well as criminal wrong and merely because a civil\\naction is also pursued, it does not render the criminal action impermissible, in the facts of the case,\\nit appears to us that long after the completion of civil suits, the further investigation in connection\\nwith the complaints may not be expedient. It may be noted that the opinion given by the Senior\\nManager (Legal) that the credit facility which was given to DAIL for its tobacoo division should be\\ntransferred to the newly formed Company, namely, New Tabacoo Company Limited, cannot be held\\nto be per se malafide or illegal in vies of the provisions of Section 394 of the Companies Act.

It may be noted that no allegation has been made against the members of the Board.\\nIn the facts of the case, it appears to use that there is enough justification for the High Court to hold\\nthat the case was basically a matter of civil dispute. It Banks had already filed suits for recovery of\\nthe dues of the Banks on account of credit facility and said suits have been compromised on\\nreceiving the payments from the concerned Companies. Even if an offence of cheating is prima facie\\nconstituted, such offence is compoundable offence and compromise decrees passed in the suits\\ninstituted by the banks, for all intents and purposes, amount to compounding of the offence of\\ncheating. It is also to be noted that long time has elapsed since the complaint was filed in 1987. It\\nmay also be indicated that although such FIRs were filed in 1987 and 1989, the Banks have not\\nchosen to institute any case against the alleged erring official despite allegations made against them\\nin the FIRs. Considering that the investigations had not been completed till 1991 even though there\\nwas no impediment to complete the investigations and further investigations are still pending and\\nalso considering the fact that the claims of the Banks have been compromised on receiving\\npayments, we do not think that the said complaints should be pursued any further, In our view\\nproceeding further with the complaints will not be expedient.

Incestous\\nsexual abuse, incredulous ex facie, is being attributed to the husband. Police on her\\ncomplaint conducted investigation and laid charge sheet against the appellant, who\\nhas filed this Criminal Appeal special leave as he did not succeed in his approach to\\nthe High court at the F.I.R. stage itself.\\nMore details of the case are these:\\nAppellant (Satish Mehra) and his wife (Anita Mehra) were living in New York ever\\nsince their marriage. They have three children among whom the eldest daughter\\n(Nikita) was born of 2nd April, 1988. Before and after the birth of the children\\nrelationship between husband and wife was far from cordial. Husband alleged that\\nhis wife, in conspiracy with her father, had siphoned off a whopping sum from his\\nbank deposits in India by forging his signature. He also alleged that his wife is\\nsuffering from some peculiar psychiatric condition. He approached a court at New\\nYork for securing custody of his children. On 31.10.1992 his wife left his house with\\nthe children and then filed a complaint with Saffolk County Police Station (United\\nStates) alleging that her husband had sexually abused Nikita who was then aged four.\\nUnited States police at the local level moved into action. But after conducting detailed\\ninvestigation concluded that the allegations of incestuous abuse are untrue.\\nOn 7.3.1993, appellant\\'s wife (Anita) returned to India with her children. In the\\nmeanwhile Family Court at New York has ordered that custody of the children be\\ngiven to the husband and a warrant of arrest was issued against Anita for\\nimplementation of the said order.\\nThe battle field between the parties was thereafter shifted to India as she came back\\nhome. On 19.3.1993, Anita filed a complaint to the \"Crime Against Women Cell\"\\n(CAW Cell for short) New Delhi in which she stated that her husband committed sex\\nabuses with Nikita while they were in United States and further alleged that appellant\\ncommitted certain matrimonial misdemeanour on his wife. But the complain was\\nclose but want of jurisdiction for the CAW Cell to investigate into what happened in\\nUnited States. Appellant returned to India on 127.1993 and thereafter filed a petition\\nfor a writ of Habeas Corpus for securing the custody of the children.\\nThe present case is based on a complaint filed by Anita before Greater Kailash Police\\nstation on 14.8.1993. FIR was prepared and a case was registered as Crime No.\\n197/93 for offences under Sections 354 and 498-A of Indian Penal Code. On\\n25.8.1993, the investigating officer moved the Sessions Court for adding Section 376\\nof the IPC also.

Learned Session judge, by a detailed order, found that no charge under\\nSection 498-A IPC could be framed against the appellant, but charge for offences\\nunder Sections 354 and 376 read with Section 511 of IPC should be framed against\\nhim. Accordingly, the charge has been framed with the said two counts.\\nFirst count in the charge is that appellant had outraged the modesty of his minor\\ndaughter aged about 3 years during some time between March and July, 1991 at D-\\n108, East of Kailash, New Delhi by fondling with her vagina and also by inserting\\nbottle into it and thereby committed the offence under Section 354 of the IPC. Second\\ncount in the charge is that he made an attempt to commit rape on the said infant\\nchild (time and place are the same) and thereby committed the offence under Section\\n376 read with Section 511 of the IPC.\\nAt this stage it is superfluous to consider whether the FIR is liable to be quashed as both sides\\nargued on the sustainability of the charge framed by the Sessions Judge. We are, therefore,\\nconsidering the main question whether the Sessions Court should have framed the charge against\\nthe appellant as it did now.\\nConsiderations which should weigh with the Sessions Court at this state have been well designed by\\nthe Parliament through Section 227 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short \\'the Code\\') which\\nreads thus:\\n\"227. Discharge. - If, upon consideration of the record of the case and the documents\\nsubmitted therewith, and after hearing the submissions of the accused and the\\nprosecution there is not sufficient ground for proceeding accused and record his\\nreasons for so doing.\"\\nSection 228 contemplates the stage after the case survives the stage envisaged in the former section.\\nWhen the Court is of opinion that there is ground to presume that the accused has committed and\\noffence the procedure laid down therein has to be adopted. When those two section are put\\njuxtaposition with each other the test to be adopted becomes discernible: Is there sufficient ground\\nfor proceeding against the accused? It is axiomatic that the standard of proof normally adhered to at\\nthe final stage is not to be applied at the stage where the scope of consideration is where there is\\n\"sufficient ground for proceeding\". (Vide State of Bihar v. Ramesh Singh, AIR 1977 SO 2018, and\\nSupdt, & Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, West Bengal v. Anil Kumar Bhunja, 1979 Cr. L.J. 1390:\\nAIR 1980 SC 52).\\nIn Alamohan Das v. State of West Bengal (AIR 1970 SC\\n863) Shah, j. (as he then was) has observed in the context of considering the scope of committal\\nproceedings under Section 209 of the old Code of Criminal Procedure (1898) that a Judge can sift\\nand weight the materials on record by seeing whether there is sufficient evidence for commitment.

Of course the exercise is to find out whether a prima facie case\\nagainst the accused has been made out.\\nIn Union of India v. Profullakumar- 1979 Cr.L.J. 154, this Court has observed that the Judge while\\nconsidering the question of framing the charge has \"the undoubted power to sift and wight the\\nevidence for the limited purpose of finding out whether a prima facie case against the accused has\\nbeen made out\". However, there Lordships pointed out that the test to determine a prima facie case\\nwould naturally dependent upon the facts of each case and it is difficult to lay down a rule of\\nuniversal application. \"By and large, however, if who view are equally possible and the Judge is\\nsatisfied that the evidence produced before him gives rise to some suspicion but not grave\\nsuspension, the Judge would be fully within his right to discharge the accused\". At the same time the\\nCourt cautioned that a roving enquiry into the pros and cons of the case by weighing the evidence as\\nif he was conducting the trial is not expected or even warranted at this stage.\\nAn incidental question which emerges in this context is whether the Session Judge can look into any\\nmaterial other than those produced by the prosecution. Section 226 of the Code obliges the\\nprosecution to describe the charge brought against the accused and to state by what evidence the\\nguilt of the accused would be proved. The Next provisions enjoins on the Session Judge to decide\\nwhether there is sufficient ground to proceed against the accused. In so deciding the Judge has to\\nconsider (1) the record of the case and (2) the documents produced therewith. He has then to hear\\nthe submissions of the accused as well as the prosecution on the limited question whether there is\\nsufficient ground to proceed. What is the scope of hearing the submissions? Should it be confined to\\nhearing oral arguments alone?\\nSimilar situation arise under Section 239 of the Code (which deals with trial of warrant cases on\\npolice report). In that situation the Magistrate has to afford the prosecution and the accused an\\nopportunity of being heard besides considering the police report and the documents sent therewith.\\nAt these two State the Code enjoins on the Court to give audience to the accused for deciding\\nwhether it is necessary to proceed to the next State. It is a matter of exercise of judicial mind. There\\nis nothing in the code which shrinks the scope of such audience to oral arguments. If the accused\\nsucceeds in producing any reliable material at that stage which might fatally affect even the very\\nsustainability of the case, it is unjust to suggest that no such material shall be looked into by the\\nCourt at that stage. Here the \"ground\" may be any valid ground including insufficiency of evidence\\nto prove charge.\\nThe object of providing such an opportunity as is envisaged in Section 227 of the code is to enable\\nthe Court to decide whether it is necessary to proceed to conduct the trial. If the case ends there it\\ngains a lot of time of the Court and saves much human efforts and cost. If the materials produced by\\nthe accused even at that early stage would clinch the issue, why should the Court shut it out saying\\nthat such documents need be produced only after wasting a lot more time in the name of trial\\nproceedings. Hence, we are of the view that Sessions Judge would be within his powers to consider\\neven material which the accused may produce at the stage contemplated in Section 227 of the Code.Sh.

We are under heavy\\npressure of work-load. If the Sessions Judge is almost certain that the trial would only be an exercise\\nin futility or a sheer waste of time it is advisable to truncate or ship the proceedings at the stage of\\nSection 227 of the Code itself.\\nIn the present case learned Session Judge has missed certain germane aspects. Apart form the\\nseemingly incredulous nature of the accusations against a father that he molested his infant child\\n(who would have just passed her suckling stage the) the Sessions Judge out not to have overlooked\\nthe following telling circumstances.\\nThe complaint made by her with the New York police that her husband committed sexual offences\\nagainst her 18 months old female child was investigated by the New York police and found the\\ncomplaint bereft of truth hook, line and sinker. The present charge is that the appellant committed\\nsuch offences against the same child at East Kailash, New Delhi some time during March to July,\\n1991. There is now no case of what happened in United States. There is now no case of what\\nhappened in United States. The Sessions Judge should have noted that appellant\\'s wife has not even\\nremotely alleged in the complaint filed by her on 19.3.1993 before CAW Cell , New Delhi that\\nappellant has done anything like that while he was in India. Even the other complaint. petition (on\\nwhich basis the FIR was prepared) is totally silent about a case that appellant did anything against\\nhis daughter anywhere in India. when we perused the statement of Anita Mehra (second\\nrespondent) we felt no doubt that the has been brimming with acerbity towards the petitioner on\\naccount of other causes. She describes her marital life with petitioner as \\'extremely painful and\\nunhappy from the very inception\". She complains that petitioner has \"a history of irrational\\noutbursts of temper and violence\". She accused him of being alcoholic and prone to inflicting server\\nphysical violence on her form 1980 onwards.\\nThus her attitude to the petitioner, even de hors the allegation involving the child, was vengeful. We\\ntake into account the assertion of the of the petitioner that the present story involving Nikita was\\nconcocted by the second respondent to wreak her vengeance by embroiling him in serious criminal\\ncases in India so that the could be nailed down here and prevent him from going back to U.S.A.\\nWhile hearing the arguments we ascertained whether the spouses could settle their differences.\\nSecond respondent, who to was present in court, made an offer through her counsel that she could\\nagree for annulling the criminal proceedings against the petitioner on the condition that he should\\nwithdraw his claims on the bank deposits and would also relinquish his claim for custody of the\\nchildren, and further he should concede for a divorce. In response to the said conditional offer,\\npetitioner agreed to give up all his claims on the large amounts in bank deposits, and further agreed\\nto have the divorce. But he stood firm that on no account custody of the children could go to the\\nsecond respondent but if made to, subject to his rights of visitation. This, he said, is because he is\\nconvinced that second respondent is unsuitable to be entrusted with the care of the children.\\nIn the above context petitioner drew our special notice to a medical report issued by Dr. Prabha\\nKapoor (Children Medical Centre, Jorbagh, New Delhi) On 26.7.1992.

To substantiate this allegation he drew our\\nattention to the U.S. police report, in which there is mention of a medical examination conducted on\\nNikita by a U.S. doctor (Dr. Gordon) on 24.11.92. That doctor pointed out that there was absolutely\\nno indication of any sexual abuse when the child was physically examined. If the medical\\nexamination done on the child in November, 1992 showed such normal condition, petitioner posed\\nthe question -who would have meddled with the child\\'s genitals before 26.7.93, to case such a\\nwidening of the vaginal office? (We now remember again that, as per present case, the last occasion\\nwhen the petitioner should have abused the child was in July, 1991). The aforesaid question, posed\\nby the petitioner in the context of expressing grave concern over what the mother might do with the\\nlittle female child for creating evidence of sex abuse, cannot be sideline by us in considering whether\\nthe case should proceed to the trial stage.\\nPetitioner invited out attention to the answers which Mrs. Veena Sharma (of CAWC) has elicited\\nfrom Nikita, a verbatim reproduction of which is given in the counter affidavit filed by the second\\nrespondent. The said interrogation record reveals that Mrs. Veena Sharma has practically put on the\\ntongue of the little girl that her father had molested her. The following questions and answers can\\nbring the point home the questions. The questioner asked the child \"what your dady did with you\"\\nand the child answered that he put his finger (and showed her private part). Not being satisfied with\\nthe answer the next question put to the child was \"Dady puts what else\". Then Nikita answers \"Dady\\nputs his bottle\". We noticed with disquiet that the questioner drew the picture of the petitioner -face\\nbody and then asked certain questions such as \"where is papa\\'s bottle? Is it on the cupboard?\" The\\nchild kept looking at the drawn sketch and pointed to the part between legs. Questioner then asked\\nif anything was missing in the picture, to which Nikita Answered \"glesses\". After the child again\\npointed to the private parts between the legs, the questioner wanted the child to draw \"papa\\'s\\nbottle\". But then the child told her \"you do it.\" The questioner at the stage had the temerity to draw\\nthe picture of the private parts of child\\'s father. We are much disturbed at the manner in which the\\nlittle child was interrogated by the said officer of CAW Cell. At any rate we have no doubt that the\\npurpose of such questions was to lead the child unmistakably to the tutored answers.\\nEven overlooking all the inherent infirmities shrouding the testimony of a tiny tot speaking about\\nwhat her further did when she was aged 3 and even ignoring the appellant\\'s persistent submission\\nthat the little child was briskly tutored by her mother to speak to the present version, There is no\\nreasonable prospect of the sessions court relaying on such a testimony to reach the conclusion that\\nthe prosecution succeeded in proving the offence charged beyond all reasonable doubt.\\nOver and above that, what would be the consequence if this nebulous allegation is allowed to\\nproceed to the trial stage.

Her revision before the District Judge Dehradun against this\\norder was dismissed. She further filed writ petition under Article 227 of the\\nConstitution of India in the High Court.

The husband at that time was an army officer. He retired\\nand Lt. Colonel on August 10, 1986. On September 28, 1989 he filed the petition for divorce against\\nhis wife under Section 13 of the Act on the alleged grounds of cruelty and desertion. He stated that\\nwithin two years of the marriage the wife started creating problem for him and she persisted in her\\nbehaviour right till the year 1989. In this span of 26 years in their married life, they have become the\\nparents of four children, two sons and two daughters. Eldest daughter who is 34 years old and\\nunmarried is living with her mother who maintains her. Second child is so who is working with\\nMukul Overseas Pvt.

She is also unmarried and\\nunemployed and is living with the father. Fourth child is a son of 20 years of age, he is unemployed\\nand had studied upto 11th class. Husband says that being head of the family he is to maintain two\\nsons and a daughter as they are dependent on him. His claim is that he is presently having a meagre\\nsalary of Rs. 5000/- per month and is employed as consultant/adviser with M/s. Mukul\\nInternational Private Limited.

After deduction of income-tax at source, husband says he is getting an amount of Rs.\\n4700/- per month. Husband admits that he has a house in NOIDA which was on rent with the army\\nand lease was terminated by letter dated January 29, 1996 from the Ministry of Defence. He says\\nrepairs are being carried on in the house and presently he is living with her eldest son in his house.\\nHe further says he is not getting any pension as on his permanent absorption in ONGC, he had\\nopted to receive lumpsum amount in lieu of pension and prorata gratuity amount in lieu of pension\\nand prorata gratuity amounting to Rs. 2,60,456/-. In addition the husband also received an amount\\nof Rs. 55,775/- on account of D.C.R. Gty. Husband has also filed his computation of taxable income\\nfor the assessment years 1992- 93, 1995-96 and 1996-97. He has though not filed any assessment\\norder. Since he retired from ONGC in August, 1995 it would be appropriate to see his computation\\nof taxable income for the year ending March 31, 1995. His gross salary income in Rs. 1,88,281/- and\\nafter deduction of House Rent Allowance it comes to Rs. 1,78,614. Income from house property he\\nsay is Rs. 22716/-, interest income is Rs. 3179/-. Total of these three items would be Rs. 2,04,509/-.\\nThen there are claims of standard deduction, repairs in the house and tax rebate on saving\\namounting to Rs. 68,922/- which include payment on account of LIC, PF, PPF, MEP, NSC and\\ngeneral insurance. The amount of tax payable comes to Rs. 35716/- on a taxable income of Rs.\\n1,81,790/-. For the assessment year 1996-97 (year ending on March 31, 1996) the salary income\\nshown is 1,18,151/-, income from house property is Rs. 18, 930/- and after standard deduction, and\\nother deduction and the rebate the income tax payable is Rs. 18, 464/- on the net income of Rs.\\n1,31,200/-.\\nWife says that the husband has not given true account of his assets and income and has rather\\nsuppressed the same. Though the wife has not been able to give any specific evidence to support her\\ncontention but circumstance show that the husband has not given true state of affairs of his income.\\nHe has pleaded that both his wife and his eldest daughter are earning Rs. 10,000/- per month but\\nthere is no basis for such an allegation. The fact remains that the wife has no source of income and\\nshe is also maintaining her eldest unmarried daughter. Under the Hindu Adoptions & Maintenance\\nAct, 1956 it is the obligation of a person to maintain her unmarried daughter if she is unable to\\nmaintain herself. In this case since the wife has no income of her own, it is the obligation of the\\nhusband to maintain her and her two unmarried daughters one of whom is living with wife and one\\nwith him. Section 24 of the Act no doubt talks of maintenance of wife during the pendency of the\\nproceedings but this section, in our view, cannot be read in isolation and cannot be given restricted\\nmeaning to hold that it is maintenance of the wife alone and no one else. Since wife is maintaining\\nthe eldest unmarried daughter, her right to claim maintenance would include her own maintenance\\nand that of her daughter. This fact has to be kept in view while fixing the maintenance pendente lite\\nfor the wife. We are aware of the provisions of Section 26 of the Act providing for custody of minor\\nchildren, their maintenance and education but that section operates in its own field.Smt.

On one date when this appeal came up for hearing we were told that\\nthe husband had left that morning itself for Canada for further treatment after his bypass surgery in\\nIndia and that his expenses visiting the Canada and as well as the expenses for the treatment there\\nwere being met by his friend. In his affidavit husband has stated that his friend Sontosh Singh for\\nhis treatment in Canada paid his fare. He is, however, silent about the expense if any met by Sontosh\\nSingh for his treatment in Canada. A copy of the statutory declaration of Sontosh Singh which is\\ndated March 21, 1997 has also been filed. In this Sontosh Singh does say that he has undertaken to\\nbear the cost of passage and maintenance of respondent during his stay in Canada and North\\nAmerica. It is a matter of common knowledge that medical treatment in Canada is high and an\\nordinary person cannot afford the expenses which are met by taking medical insurance. As to what\\nexpenses husband incurred for his bypass surgery in India has not been disclosed. On our query as\\nto how much foreign exchange husband obtained while going to Canada, it was stated that Dollar\\nU.S. 1,350 were obtained at a cost of about Rs. 50,000/-. From where all these monies came from\\nwe are left in dark. Husband had not filed any certificate of his salary from his present employer\\nthough the wife has contended that both the firms Mukul Overseas Pvt. Ltd and Mukul International\\nPvt. Ltd. are owned by the husband himself which fact husband had denied. Though we are not\\nconcerned with the income of his son which is stated to be Rs. 7,500/- per month, it would have\\nbeen better if the husband had given complete details as to the perquisites enjoyed by his son, the\\nrent he is paying for his rented accommodation at Safdarjung Enclave and the like. Claim of the\\nhusband that though his house in NOIDA fell vacant in January, 1996, it has neither been further let\\nnor the husband himself living there because of certain repairs and on that account he is residing\\nwith his son does not appeal to us. It does appear to us from the affidavit of the husband that it\\nconceals more than what it tells of his income and other assets. Attempt has been made to conceal\\nhis true income and that leads us to draw an adverse inference against the husband about his\\nincome that it is much more than what is being disclosed to us. The claim of the husband that from\\nan income of Rs. 4,750/- per month which is getting from Mukul International Pvt. Ltd. he has to\\nmaintain himself, his two sons and daughter is absorb particularly when the eldest son is earning\\nmore than the husband and it is the husband who is living with him. Husband has also not disclosed\\nretrial benefits if any from the ONGC and the amount of provident fund he obtained from there.\\nHusband has interest income from Unit Trust of India and also from the fixed deposit receipt but\\nagain he has not disclosed the number of units he is holding and the amount of the fixed deposits in\\nhis name, from all these we have to hold that the annual income of the respondent-husband is even\\non modest estimate to be Rs. 2,40,000/- annually which would come to Rs. 20,000/- per month.\\nConsidering the diverse claims made by the parties one inflating the income and the other\\nsuppressing an element of conjecture and guess work does enter for arriving at the income of the\\nhusband. It cannot be done by any mathematical precision.\\nWife has no fixed abode of residence She say she is living in Gurudwara with her eldest daughter for\\nsafety. On the other hand husband has sufficient income and a house to him. Wife has not claimed\\nand litigation expenses in this appeal. She is aggrieved only because of the paltry amount of\\nmaintenance fixed by the court. No set formula can be laid for fixing the amount of maintenance.

Amount of maintenance fixed for the wife should be such as she can live in reasonable\\ncomfort considering her status and the mode of life she was used to when she lived with her\\nhusband and also that she does not feel handicapped in the prosecution of her case. At the same\\ntime, the amount so fixed cannot be excessive or extortionate. In the circumstances of the present\\ncase we fix maintenance pendente lite at the rate of Rs. 5,000/- per month payable by\\nrespondent-husband to the appellant-wife.\\nThe question then arises as to from which date the wife would be entitled to claim the enhanced\\namount of maintenance pendente lite. If wife has no source of income it is the obligation of the\\nhusband to maintain her and also children of the marriage on the basis of the provision contained in\\nthe Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956. Her right to claim maintenance fructifies on the\\ndate of the filing of the petition for divorce under the Act. Having thus fixed the date as the filing of\\nthe petition for divorce it is not always that the court has to grant the maintenance from that date.\\nThe court has discretion in the matter as to from which date maintenance under Section 24 of the\\nAct should be granted. The discretion of the court would depend upon multiple circumstance which\\nare to be kept in view. These could be the time taken to serve the respondent in the petition the date\\nof filing of the application under Section 241 of the Act; conduct of the parties in the proceedings;\\naverments made in the application and the reply there to; the tendency of the wife to inflate the\\nincome out of all proportion and that of the husband to suppress the same; and the like. There has\\nto be honesty of purpose for both the parties which unfortunately we find lacking in this case. We\\nare therefore of the opinion that ends of justice would be met if we direct that maintenance\\npendente lite as fixed by this judgment to be payable from the date of impugned order of the High\\nCourt which is October 16, 1996. We order accordingly. The impugned judgment of the High Court\\nshall stand modified to that extent.

It is not in dispute that from 28.05.1991, the deceased was not seen. PW-5 had been trying to\\ncontact her on phone. She was informed by the appellant that the deceased had gone to Hyderabad.\\nIn June 1991, when contacted, she was informed that her mother had gone to Kutch to attend a\\nwedding. A week thereafter it was informed to her that the deceased had been lying low owing to\\nsome income tax problems. She, being exasperated with the said explanations, came down to\\nBangalore. She did not find her mother there. She was told that the deceased being pregnant had\\ngone to United States of America for delivery of the child. She was told to have been admitted in\\nRoosevelt Hospital. She made verifications thereabout through her acquaintances and came to know\\nthat no such woman had ever been admitted to the said hospital.

We will hereinafter notice the circumstances which existed in establishing the commission of the\\ncrime.\\n34. PW-5 Sabah Khaleeli, was the daughter of the deceased through her first husband. She in her\\ndeposition categorically stated that she had spoken to her mother on 19.04.1991. She was not\\navailable on phone from May, 1991 onwards. Gauhar Namazee (PW-25) was the mother of the\\ndeceased. She in her deposition stated that she had last seen the deceased on 13.04.1991. She had\\nnot been cross-examined on the said point. It is also not disputed that PW-18 and PW-19, who were\\nhusband and wife, were engaged by the deceased. They saw the deceased in the company of the\\nappellant in the morning of 28.05.1991, for the last time. The said witnesses were staying in a\\nservant quarter in the said premises. PW-18 was working as gardener-cum-handyman; whereas\\nPW-19 was working as maid servant, since 1988. They stated in unison that they had seen the\\ndeceased at about 07.30 A.M. on that day. According to PW-19, she went to the kitchen to prepare\\ntea for the couple and kept the tea cups on the dining table. She in no uncertain terms stated that the\\ncups of tea were taken by the appellant to the bed-room where the deceased was reading a\\nnewspaper. PW-19 while sweeping the house was called by the deceased and was instructed to clean\\nthe articles kept in the showcase instead of sweeping. They, however, received a telegram at about\\n10.00 a.m. whereby they were informed that the sister-in-law of PW-19 was sick at Gudisuvarapally\\nin the State of Andhra Pradesh. They sought for leave and some money. They were permitted to\\nleave Bangalore and were asked to collect the requisite amount after some time. They came back to\\ntheir quarters and started packing their goods. At about 1.30 p.m. they went back to the house.\\nPW-18, however, was said to have been asked by the appellant herein to shift a wooden box kept in\\nthe guest house to the bed room before leaving. They together with some others took a large wooden\\nbox from the guest house and kept the same inside the bed room, where they found the deceased\\nsleeping on the bed. They were thereafter paid a sum of Rs.1,200/- towards their salary and\\nadditional sum of Rs.500/- towards travelling expenses. They left for their home. They came back\\nafter a couple of days, but did not find the deceased. The said two witnesses in their depositions\\ncorroborated each other.\\n35. We have noticed hereinbefore that the appellant had applied for grant of anticipatory bail in\\nJuly, 1992 i.e. after the missing complaint was filed by PW-5. In the said application for bail, the\\nappellant himself disclosed that the deceased had left for unknown destination in the month of May,\\n1991, allegedly because of her agitated mental condition.\\n36. If it is proved that the deceased died in an unnatural circumstance in her bed room, which was\\noccupied only by her and her husband, law requires the husband to offer an explanation in this\\nbehalf. We, however, do not intend to lay down a general law in this behalf as much would depend\\nupon the facts and circumstances of each case. Absence of any explanation by the husband would\\nlead to an inference which would lead to a circumstance against the accused.\\n37.

The accused also does not deny that he was with the\\ndeceased at his house on the day of occurrence. The house of the accused, according\\nto plan PM, consists of one residential room one other small room and a varandah.\\nThe correctness of that plan is proved by A. R. Verma overseer (PW 5). The fact that\\nthe accused alone was with Churi deceased in the house when she was murdered\\nthere with the Khokhri and the fact that the relations of the accused with the\\ndeceased, as would be shown hereafter, were strained would, in the absence of any\\ncogent explanation by him, point to his guilt.\"\\nIn Trimukh Maroti Kirkan v.

We have noticed hereinbefore as to why the investigation was taken over by the Central Crime\\nBranch. As the interrogation of the appellant, while in custody of the police, revealed the possibility\\nof the deceased having been buried in the backyard of her residential house, the Investigating\\nOfficer requested the Sub-Divisional Magistrate to conduct exhumation proceedings, who in turn,\\nauthorized the Taluka Executive Magistrate (PW-3) to do so. Confession of the accused was not\\nadmissible in evidence. What was admissible only was that part of the confession leading to the\\ndiscovery of fact in terms of Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act. The proceedings were conducted\\nin the presence of the accused, which were videographed and marked as MO-18.

The\\nvideograph further showed that the backyard flooring was of well laid Cuddapah\\nstones property cemented. In such a situation, in our view, nobody except the person\\nwho buried the box could have the knowledge of its burial.\"\\n39. Discovery of the last remains of the deceased was a relevant fact, which was, thus, admissible in\\nevidence. Appellant had pinpointed the exact place which was to be dug up.

He also made an oral statement that the box was buried beneath the area so marked, location\\nwhereof showed that it was a big area, flooring of which had been well plastered with cement having\\nCuddapah stone slabs.

In Aloke Nath Dutta (supra), in regard to applicability of Section 26 and Section 27 of the Indian\\nEvidence Act, it was stated :\\n\"The policy underlying behind Sections 25 and 26 is to make it a substantive rule of\\nlaw that confessions whenever and wherever made to the police, or while in the\\ncustody of the police to any person whomsoever unless made in the immediate\\npresence of a magistrate, shall be presumed to have been obtained under the\\ncircumstances mentioned in Section 24 and, therefore, inadmissible, except so far as\\nis provided by Section 27 of the Act.\"\\n41.

In his statements before the investigating officer, he made a\\nconfession; but what was admissible in evidence his only that part which would come within the\\npurview of Section 27 of the Evidence Act and not the rest.

It is also not\\npermissible to start with the confession and find corroborative evidence thereof and come back to\\nthe confession again for the purpose of arriving at a conclusion of guilt.\\n46. What was, therefore, relevant for the purpose of Section 27 of the Evidence Act was that at the\\ninstance of the appellant himself a particular place which had been pin pointed by him had been dug\\nand remains of a body and other articles were recovered.\\n47. The various circumstances leading to the pointing out the guilt of the appellant and appellant\\nalone have been enumerated by us hereinbefore. From our discussions, it is evident that each of the\\ncircumstances had been established, the cumulative effect whereof would show that all the links in\\nthe chain are complete and the conclusion of the guilt is fully established.\\n48. We are not oblivious of the fact that there is a material difference distance between \\'may be\\' and\\n\\'must be\\' and furthermore in a case of this nature the evidence must be considered with more than\\nordinary care lest the shocking nature of crime induce an instinctive reaction against a dispassionate\\njudicial scrutiny of the facts and law.

This Court had also the occasion therein to notice the growing demand in the international fora\\nand in particular the second Optional Protocol to the International Covenants on Civil and Political\\nRights and the Protocol to the American Constitution on Human Rights abolished that death\\npenalty should be abolished.\\n51. Recently, the Privy Council in Reyes v. R. [(2002) UKPC 11 : 12 BHRC 219] and Hughes, R. v.\\n(Saint Lucia) [(2002) UKPC 12], noticing the decision of this Court in Mithu v.

The Queen (2006) 1 WLR 1623 and Coard & Ors. v. The\\nAttorney General (Grenada), (2007) UKPC 7].\\n52. Abolition of death penalty is not being and, in fact, cannot be advocated; but what requires\\nserious consideration is as to whether the jurisdiction should not be invoked unless there exists an\\nextra-ordinary situation to find that it comes within the purview of \"rarest of rare\" cases. The\\napproach of the courts should not be to confine its thought process to the identification of a \"rare\"\\ncase. The expression \"rarest of rare\" case has been evolved by a Constitution Bench of this Court\\nand, thus, demands a meaningful application.\\n53. It is interesting to note that Bhagwati, J. in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab [(1982) 3 SCC 24],\\nwhile expressing his dissenting opinion, noticed as under :\\n\"□This arbitrariness in the imposition of death penalty is considerably accentuated by\\nthe fragmented Bench structure of our courts where Benches are inevitably formed\\nwith different permutations and combinations from time to time and cases relating to\\nthe offence of murder come up for hearing sometimes before one Bench, sometimes\\nbefore another sometimes before a third and so on. Professor Blackshield has in his\\narticle on Capital Punishment in India published in Volume 21 ot the Journal of the\\nIndian Law Institute□ pointed out how the practice of Bench formation contributes to\\narbitrariness in the imposition of death penalty. It is well known that so far as the\\nSupreme Court is concerned, while the number of Judges has increased over the\\nyears, the number of Judges on Benches which hear capital punishment cases has\\nactually decreased. Most cases are now heard by two-Judge Benches. Professor\\nBlackshield has abstracted 70 cases in which the Supreme Court had to choose\\nbetween life and death while sentencing an accused for the offence of murder and\\nanalysing these 70 cases he has pointed out that during the period April 28, 1972 to\\nMarch 8, 1976 only 11 Judges of the Supreme Court participated in 10 per cent or\\nmore of the cases. He has listed these 11 Judges in an ascending order of leniency\\nbased on the proportion for each Judge of plus votes (i.e. votes for the death\\nsentence) to total votes and pointed out that these statistics show how the judicial\\nresponse to the question of life and death varies from judge to judge. It is significant\\nto note that out of 70 cases analysed by Professor Blackshield, 37 related to the\\nperiod subsequent to the coming into force of Section 354, sub-section (3) of theSwamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 14'),\n",

If a similar exercise is performed with reference to\\ncases decided by the Supreme Court after March 8, 1976, that being the date up to\\nwhich the survey carried out by Professor Blackshield was limited, the analysis will\\nreveal the same pattern of incoherence and arbitrariness, the decision to kill or not to\\nkill being guided to a large extent by the composition of the Bench. Take for example\\nRajendra Prasad case decided on February 9, 1979. In this case, the death sentence\\nimposed on Rajendra Prasad was commuted to life imprisonment by a majority\\nconsisting of Krishna Iyer, J. and Desai, J., A.P. Sen, J. dissented and was of the view\\nthat the death sentence should be confirmed. Similarly in one of the cases before us,\\nnamely, Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, when it was first heard by a Bench\\nconsisting of Kailasam and Sarkaria, JJ., Kailasam, J. was definitely of the view that\\nthe majority decision in Rajendra Prasad case9 was wrong and that is why he referred\\nthat case to the Constitution Bench. So also in Dalbir Singh v. State of Punjab, the\\nmajority consisting of Krishna Iyer, J. and Desai, J. took the view that the death\\nsentence imposed on Dalbir Singh should be commuted to life imprisonment while\\nA.P. Sen, J. stuck to the original view taken by him in Rajendra Prasad case9 and was\\ninclined to confirm the death sentence, It will thus be seen that the exercise of\\ndiscretion whether to inflict death penalty or not depends to a considerable extent on\\nthe value system and social philosophy of the Judges constituting the Bench□\"\\n54. We are not oblivious of a line of decisions of this Court where the doctrine of proportionality has\\nbeen applied, even in the matter of awarding death penalty. [See State of Rajasthan v. Kheraj Ram,\\n(2003) 8 SCC 224, Bablu @ Mubarik Hussain v. State of Rajasthan, 2006 (14) SCALE 15 and Shivu\\nand Anr. v. R.G. High Court of Karnataka and Anr. 2007 (3) SCALE 157]\\n55. In this case we need not go into the correctness or otherwise of the said view. Although it is also\\nnot necessary to do so, we may notice some development of law in this regard.\\n56. Criminal Justice Act 1991 of England famously hailed doctrine of proportionality as the guiding\\nprinciple. But since the 1991 legislation, field of sentencing has seen much reform and Criminal\\nJustice Act of 2003 presents a fresh set of sentencing objectives. Section 142 of the Act delineates\\nthe following as the purposes of sentencing:\\n\"142 Purposes of sentencing (1) Any court dealing with an offender in respect of his\\noffence must have regard to the following purposes of sentencing-\\n(a) the punishment of offenders,\\n(b) the reduction of crime (including its reduction by deterrence),\\n(c) the reform and rehabilitation of offenders,\\n(d) the protection of the public, andSwamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 15'),\n",

In this context it, a reference should also be made of the Halliday Report of 2001 (Making\\nPuncishments Work) which has some interesting insights to offer on the sentencing structure in\\nEngland and Wales. In the same vein, a White Paper in 2002 has made a case of reforms and\\nsuggested a shift from the proportionality principle.\\n58. In fine, scholarship on sentencing which has been quite diverse in its prescriptions certainly has\\nconsensus on the point that any decision on sentencing aspect would require assessing more than\\none variables and single minded pursuit of any one sentencing ideal would be discounting on other\\nequally urgent parameters and objectives.\\n59. We do not have a sentencing policy, unlike some other countries. England has the concept of\\n\"guideline judgments\" which is considered as a judge managed sentencing model rather than a\\nstatute induced one. Section 354 (3) suggests that Indian law furthers statute induced sentencing\\nguidance in part. Therefore it has to be given full colour.\\n60. We have no practice of referring such matters to superior courts for laying down the guidelines\\nrelating to imposition of sentence under various situations. [See The Queen v. Julie McGinley and\\nMichael Monaghan, (2003) NICC 1]\\n61. In our country, therefore, each case may have to be considered on its own merit.\\n62. It may be of some interest to note that Furman v. Georgia [408 U.S. 238 (1972)] ruled on the\\nrequirement for a degree of consistency in the application of the death penalty.\\nJustice Stewart held that:\\n\"The penalty of death differs from all other forms of criminal punishment, not in\\ndegree, but in kind. It is unique in its total irrevocability. It is unique in its rejection\\nof rehabilitation of the convict as a basic purpose of criminal justice. And it is unique,\\nfinally, in its absolute renunciation of all that is embodied in our concept of\\nhumanity.\\n*** *** *** These death sentences are cruel and unusual in the same way that being\\nstruck by lightning is cruel and unusual. For, of all the people convicted of rapes and\\nmurders in 1967 and 1968, many just as reprehensible as these, the petitioners are\\namong a capriciously selected random handful upon whom the sentence of death has\\nin fact been imposed.\"\\n63.

Indeed, the very words \"cruel\\nand unusual punishments\" imply condemnation of the arbitrary infliction of severe\\npunishments.\"\\n64. It is important to refer to Harbans Singh v. Union of India [AIR 1982 SC 849] at this juncture. In\\nthat case three people were sentenced to death by the trial court for playing an equal part in jointly\\nmurdering a family of four persons. The sentence of all the three was confirmed by the High Court.\\nEach of them moved to the Supreme Court by different Special Leave Petitions before three separate\\nbenches. One of the accused\\'s petition was dismissed and he was actually executed. Another\\'s\\npetition was allowed and his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. And the petition\\nof the third one was also dismissed. He filed a review petition, which was also dismissed, and the\\nExecutive refused clemency. He then moved another petition before the Supreme Court bringing to\\nlight this arbitrariness. The Supreme Court recommended the President to commute his sentence.\\nChandrachud J. while lamenting the death of dead accused said:\\n\"The fate of Jeeta Singh has a posthumous moral to tell. He cannot profit by the\\ndirection which we propose to give because he is now beyond the process of human\\ntribunals.\"\\n65. Bentham\\'s discourse on determination of minimum punishment and maximum punishment\\nserves as a yardstick in this context. Bentham in his landmark treatise Principles of Penal Law\\npropose to establish a proportion between crimes and punishments. But he cautions against an\\noracular understanding than an instructive one. We here further go in the details of what doctrine of\\nproportionality holds in the realm of sentencing. The first rule of proportionality mandates:\\n\"The value of the punishment must not be less in any case than what is sufficient to\\noutweigh that of the profit of the offence.\"\\nWhile talking of minimum punishment Bentham observes:\\n\"Punishments may be too small or too great; and there are reasons for not making\\nthem too small, as well as not making them too great. The terms minimum and\\nmaximum may serve to mark the two extremes of this question, which require equal\\nattention.\\nWith a view of marking out the limits of punishment on the side of the first of these\\nextremes, we may lay it down as a rule:□ That the value of the punishment must not\\nbe less in any case than what is sufficient to outweigh that of the profit of the offence.Swamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 17'),\n",

It is to be appreciated here that statutorily decided minimum sentence takes into account the\\nbasic value of the crime and suffice to outweigh the profit of the offence. The moot question relates\\nto parameters to decide the maximum punishment. Setting the trail of caution on the side of\\ndetermination of maximum punishment Bentham posits:\\n\"Punishment, whatever shape it may assume, is an evil...\\nThe minimum of punishment is more clearly marked than its maximum. What is too\\nlittle is more clearly observed than what is too much. What is not sufficient is easily\\nseen, but it is not possible so exactly to distinguish an excess. An approximation only\\ncan be attained. The irregularities in the force of temptations, compel the legislator to\\nincrease his punishments till they are not merely sufficient to restrain the ordinary\\ndesires of men; but also the violence of their desires when unusually excited.\\nThe greatest danger lies in an error on the minimum side, because in this case the\\npunishment is inefficacious; but this error is least likely to occur, a slight degree of\\nattention sufficing for its escape; and when it does exist, it is at the same time clear\\nand manifest, and easy to be remedied. An error on the maximum side, on the\\ncontrary, is that to which legislators and men in general are naturally\\ninclined□antipathy, or a want of compassion for individuals who are represented as\\ndangerous and vile, pushes them onward to an undue severity. It is on this side\\ntherefore, that we should take the most preparations, as on this side there has been\\nshown the greatest disposition to err.\"\\n67. On the same point Beccaria in his historic work Of Crimes and Punishments denounced\\nretributive basis of punishment.\\n\"The aim of punishment can only be to prevent the criminal committing new crimes\\nagainst his countrymen, and to keep others from doing likewise. Punishments,\\ntherefore, and the method of inflicting them, should be chosen in due proportion to\\nthe crime so as to make the most efficacious and lasting impression on the minds of\\nmen, and the least painful impressions on the body of the criminal.\\nFor a punishment to be efficacious, it is enough that the disadvantage of the\\npunishment should exceed the advantage anticipated from the crime; in which excess\\nshould be calculate the certainty of punishment and the loss of the expected benefit.\\nEverything beyond this, accordingly, is superfluous, and therefore tyrannical.\"\\n68. There is a clear and discernible necessity of caution to set the maximum punishment in an\\noffence. And also by implication there must be intensive and exhaustive inquiry into accused relatedSwamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 18'),\n",

Therefore discretion to the\\njudiciary in this respect (to declare the maximum punishment) is of utmost critical and seminal\\nvalue. Reasons must be detailed setting clearly why any punishment other than the maximum\\npunishment will not suffice. This is a general and age-old rule of sentencing which has been\\nstatutorily recognized under section 354(3).\\n69. Reference to the decision of other jurisdictions and/or the recent trend in the international fora\\nhas not been referred to by way of precedents or even a persuasive value but the court in this age\\ncannot afford to put down blinkers on its window to the outside world.\\n70. It is noteworthy to mention here the Law Commission in its Report of 1967 took the view that\\ncapital punishment acted as a deterrent to crime. While it conceded that statistics did not prove\\nthese so-called deterrent effects. It also said that figures did not disprove them either.\\n71. Tracing the judicial view on Death Penalty, one can start with the Jagmohan Singh case (1973)\\nwhere it agreed with the Law Commission that capital punishment should be retained. But\\nsubsequent cases such as those of Ediga Anamma (1974) and Rajendra Prasad (1979) saw dissenting\\nvoices being raised in this court. These led to a hearing of the Bachan Singh (1980) case by a\\nConstitutional Bench.\\n72. In Rajendra Prasad v. State of U.P. [(1979) 3 SCR 646], it was held that the special reasons\\nnecessary for imposing a death penalty must relate not to the crime but to the criminal. It could be\\nawarded only if the security of the state and society, public order in the interest of the general public\\ncompelled that course.\\n73. The death penalty was abolished in 1965 in the U.K. Member-states of the European Union\\ncannot have the death penalty. In Canada, after the abolition of the death penalty in 1976, the\\nhomicide rate declined. In 2000, there were 542 homicides in Canada □ 16 fewer than in 1998 and\\n159 fewer than in 1975 (one year prior to the abolition of capital punishment). In 1997, the\\nAttorney-General of Massachusetts said: \"there is not a shred of credible evidence that the death\\npenalty lowers the murder rate. In fact, without the death penalty the murder rate in Massachusetts\\nis about half the national average.\"\\n74. The South African Constitutional Court unanimously ruled in 1995 that the death penalty for\\nmurder violated the country\\'s Constitution. More than 118 countries have abolished the death\\npenalty either in law or practice. The second optional protocol to the International Civil Covenant,\\nwhich came into force in 1991, mandates the abolition of the death penalty.\\n75. Whatever may be the \"merits\", \"demerits\" or \"criticism\", one cannot hope for unjustness in\\nsociety. Deterring or preventive theory may not have any application at all in respect of imposition\\nof death sentence. The law itself mandates that for imposing death sentence, special reasons are to\\nbe assigned. Imposition of death punishment is an exception in terms of sub- section (3) of Section\\n354 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

In Renuka Bai alias Rinku alias Ratan and Another v. State of Maharashtra [(2006) 7 SCC 442],\\nBalakrishnan, J.

Similarly in Bhimashya and Ors. v. Smt. Janabi @ Janawwa [2006 (14) SCALE 27], Dr. Pasayat,\\nJ. took into consideration the overall global view imparting death penalty.\\n78. This new trend, thus, must be taken into consideration only for awarding appropriate\\npunishment.\\n79. We may also note that in Ram Singh v. Sonia & Ors. [2007 (3) SCALE 106] imposition of a death\\npenalty has been upheld in the case where the accused had not only put an end to the life of her step\\nbrother and his whole family which included three tiny tots of 45 days, 2 □ = years and 4 years but\\nalso her own father, mother and sister in a very diabolic manner so as to deprive her father from\\ngiving the property to her step brother and his family. It was, in the aforementioned extraordinary\\nsituation, held:\\n\"□The fact that murders in question were committed in such a diabolic manner while\\nthe victims were sleeping, without any provocation whatsoever from the victims\\' side\\nindicates the cold-blooded and premeditated approach of the accused to cause death\\nof the victims.

Yet again, another Division Bench of this Court in Shivu (supra) has upheld the death penalty\\nwhere the accused was charged with Sections 302 and 376 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal\\nCode.

The court found that emboldened by the\\nescapes from punishment in those two incidents, the accused committed rape on the deceased a\\nyoung girl of hardly 18 years and to avoid detection committed heinous and brutal act of her\\nmurder.\\n81.

In Bishnu Prasad Sinha (supra), it was observed :\\n\"The question which remains is as to what punishment should be awarded.\\nOrdinarily, this Court, having regard to the nature of the offence, would not have\\ndiffered with the opinion of the learned Sessions Judge as also the High Court in this\\nbehalf, but it must be borne in mind that the appellants are convicted only on the\\nbasis of the circumstantial evidence.

It has been a fundamental point in numerous studies in the field of Death Penalty jurisprudence\\nthat cases where the sole basis of conviction is circumstantial evidence, have far greater chances of\\nturning out to be wrongful convictions, later on, in comparison to ones which are based on fitter\\nsources of proof. Convictions based on seemingly conclusive circumstantial evidence should not be\\npresumed as full proof incidences and the fact that the same are circumstantial evidence based must\\nbe a definite factor at the sentencing stage deliberations, considering that capital punishment is\\nunique in its total irrevocability. Any characteristic of trial, such as conviction solely resting on\\ncircumstantial evidence, which contributes to the uncertainty in the culpability calculus, must\\nattract negative attention while deciding maximum penalty for murder.\\n90. One of the older cases in this league dates back to 1874, Merritt v. State, 52 Ga. 82, 85 (1874)\\nwhere the Supreme Court of Georgia described the applicable law in Georgia as follows:\\n\"By the penal code of this state the punishment of murder shall be death, except\\nwhen the conviction is founded solely on circumstantial testimony. When the\\nconviction is had solely on circumstantial testimony, then it is discretionary with the\\npresiding judge to impose the death penalty or to sentence the defendant to\\nimprisonment in the penitentiary for life, unless the jury . . . shall recommend that\\nthe defendant be imprisoned in the penitentiary for life; in that case the presiding\\njudge has no discretion, but is bound to commute the punishment from death to\\nimprisonment for life in the penitentiary.\"\\n91. Later case of Jackson v. State, 74 Ala. 26, 29-30 (1883) followed the aforementioned case. [Also\\nsee S.M. Phillipps, Famous Cases of Circumstantial Evidence with an Introduction on the Theory of\\nPresumptive Proof 50-52 (1875)]\\n92. In United States v. Quinones, 205 F. Supp. 2d 256, 267 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) the court remarked:\\n\"Many states that allow the death penalty permit a conviction based solely on\\ncircumstantial evidence only if such evidence excludes to a moral certainty every\\nother reasonable inference except guilt.\"\\n93. In the instant case, confession before police was taken as a gospel truth. It seems that the\\njudicial mind has a role to play in that behalf in imposition of sentence.\\n94. Another aspect which needs to be considered as according to the Bachan Singh Rule (that\\nsentencing should involve analysis about the nature of crime as well as the accused) which require\\nconsideration, is the effect of two pointers relating to the nature of crime. Firstly, the case does not\\nseem to be an instance of what is called a diabolical murder. We come across cases of murdering\\nwife by burning for non-fulfillment of dowry, preceded by continuous torture. Simon and Ors. v.\\nState of Karnataka [(2004) 2 SCC 694] noting the \"all murders are cruel\" observation in Bachan\\nSingh (supra) puts the law on death penalty in perspective as:Swamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 23'),\n",

Second point relates to planning which went into committing the murder. It is agreed that\\naccused deliberately came close to the beautiful and wealthy lady. He must have had his intentions\\nand calculations in that regard. To that extent intention behind the marriage can be imputed. But to\\ninfer from that the murder was a pre-planned murder will be going a bit too far as he did not know\\nthe opportune date when the servant would be leaving the house. He could not have known the\\nservants would receive a telegram and ask for leave. Without their leaving the place, the plan, if\\nthere was any, could not have been executed. This is one weak link in the hypothesis that the murder\\nwas meticulously planned.\\n96. In Kashmir Singh v. State of Himachal Pradesh, [1990 Supp (1) SCC 133] the Court held:\\n\"There was no infirmity in appraisal of the facts and circumstances and the\\ncircumstantial evidence by the courts below in arriving at the conclusion that the\\naccused-appellant has committed the crime under Section 302 IPC. But considering\\nthe fact that it was not a pre-meditated and cold-blooded murder, and also because\\nthe appellant appeared before the Sessions Judge and made a confessional statement,\\nthe sentence is converted from death to life imprisonment.\"\\n97. Keeping the abovementioned other characteristics of the crime, we now delve into whether this\\ninstance can be categorized as a \"rarest of rare\"\\nmurder. The question is whether murder of wife for the purpose of usurping property\\nis a rarest of rare crime statistically. It is not to say that rarest of rare doctrine only\\nhas a statistical dimension i.e. incidence of particular type of murder in a given\\nsample; rarest of rare benchmark can also be used in the context of other parameters\\nsuch a brutality, planning, society\\'s reaction et al. Facets relating to nature of the\\ncrime have already been explained in terms of the few parameters mentioned just\\nnow. Therefore we attend to the incidence aspect. It can not be conclusively said that\\nmurder of wife for usurping property is a particularly rarest of rare incident. It could,\\nof course, be a rare incident.\\n98. Also it is to be realized that in criminal cases character of accused is immaterial by the mandate\\nof section 53 and 54 of Indian Evidence Act. The same should not factor in the discussions at the\\nsentencing stage. If that be so, bad character of the accused by itself should not be a determinative\\nfactor.\\n99. In fact, Appellant should not have been heard at that stage. The stage of hearing an accused\\nunder Section 235(2) of the Code is after the judgment of conviction is pronounced and not prior\\nthereto. Appellant herein made a confession before the High Court. The High Court took the same\\ninto consideration in the main judgment which could not be done. He had been brought before theSwamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 24'),\n",

His Statement was taken during midst of hearing. He knew the\\nimplications thereof. Despite the same, he made a categorical statement that he was responsible for\\nburring the dead body. He gave an explanation, which might not have found favour with the High\\nCourt, but the fact that he had made a confession at least accepting a part of the offence could not\\nhave been ignored at least for the purpose of imposition of punishment. He is more than 64 years'\\nold. He is in custody for a period of 16 years. The death sentence was awarded to him by the trial\\ncourt in terms of its judgment dated 20.05.2005. In a situation of this nature, we are of the opinion\\nthat imposition of a life imprisonment for commission of the crime under Section 302 shall serve\\nthe ends of justice.\\n100. However, while saying so, we direct that in a case of this nature 'life sentence' must be meant to\\nbe 'life sentence'. Such a direction can be given, as would appear from some precedents. {See\\nSubhash Chander v. Krishan Lal and Ors. [(2001) 4 SCC 458]}.\\n101. Yet again in Ram Anup Singh and Ors. v. State of Bihar [(2002) 6 SCC 686], this Court directed\\nthat the accused shall remain in jail for a period of not less than 20 years. [See Prakash Dhawal\\nKhairnar (Patil) v.

However, before parting with this case, we may notice that a prayer was made by Smt. Sabhah\\nKhaleeli (daughter of the deceased) that the mortal remains of Smt. Shakereh (deceased) including\\nskull are required by the family of the deceased for burial and obsequies ceremony. The High Court\\nhas issued such a direction.

The brief facts of the case are that on 20.04.2020 at about 2.30 a.m., the accused-applicant, a\\nneighbour of the complainant, entered her house and caught hold of the complainant„s hand, and\\nallegedly attempted to harass her sexually.

Bail conditions must be free from stereotypical or patriarchal notions on women and their place in\\nsociety, and must strictly be in accordance with the requirements of the CrPC.\\nvi. The Courts while adjudicating a case, should not suggest or entertain any notions (or encourage\\nany step) towards compromises between the prosecutrix and the accused to get married, as it is\\nbeyond their powers and jurisdiction.\\n17. On gender equality and gender sensitization, the Attorney General argued that to achieve the\\ngoal of gender justice, it is imperative that judicial officers, judges, and members of the bar are made\\naware of gender prejudices that hinder justice. Accordingly, he submitted that the foremost aspect to\\nfacilitate a gender sensitive approach, is to train judges to exercise their discretion and avoid the use\\nof gender- based stereotypes while deciding cases pertaining to sexual offences. Secondly, judges\\nshould have sensitivity to the concerns of the survivor of sexual offences.\\n18. Reliance was placed on the Bangkok General Guidance for Judges on Applying a Gender\\nPerspective in South East Asia, by the International Commission of Jurists. It was pointed out that\\nthe following stereotypes are often encountered in the course of judicial decision-making and should\\nbe avoided: -\\ni. Women are physically weak;\\nii.

Women often experience obstacles in gaining access to mechanisms of redress, including legal\\naid, counselling services and shelters. They are re-victimized and exposed to further risk of violence\\nthrough the denial of redress in the context of informal trials or negotiations between families and\\ncommunity leaders. The payment of financial compensation by the perpetrator or his family for acts\\nof violence against women, in lieu of legal remedies, was a recurrent concern vis-†-vis the formal\\nand informal justice systems. Violence against women in India is systematic and occurs in 20 A\\nphrase that means the traits inherent to a thing or situation, especially a negative or difficult one\\n(See https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/the+nature+of+the+beast) the public and private\\nspheres. It is underpinned by the persistence of patriarchal social norms and inter- and intra-gender\\nhierarchies. Women are discriminated against and subordinated not only on the basis of sex, but on\\nother grounds too, such as caste, class, ability, sexual orientation, tradition and other realities.21\\n21. Gender violence is most often unseen and is shrouded in a culture of silence. The causes and\\nfactors of violence against women include entrenched unequal power equations between men and\\nwomen that foster violence and its acceptability, aggravated by cultural and social norms, economic\\ndependence, poverty and alcohol consumption, etc. In India, the culprits are often known to the\\nwoman; the social and economic \"costs\" of reporting such crimes are high.

Sexual violence is varied in degree. At the highest (or, rather most aggravated) level, is rape with\\nor without attendant violence. However, there are a substantial number of incidents which fall\\nwithin the rubric of sexual violence, that amount to offences under various penal enactments.

In Sumit Mehta v. State (NCT of Delhi) (supra) this court, with respect to the conditions that can\\nbe imposed validly under section 438(2) of the CrPC, observed that:\\nƒ11.

The object of putting such conditions should be to avoid\\nthe possibility of the person hampering the investigation. Thus, any condition, which\\nhas no reference to the fairness or propriety of the investigation or trial, cannot be\\ncountenanced as permissible under the law. So, the discretion of the Court while\\nimposing conditions must be exercised with utmost restraint.□\\n28. It was urged that the observations made in Kunal Kumar and Sumit Mehta ought to be followed\\nwhile imposing bail conditions. The appellants relying upon the observations made in para 18 of\\nState of M.P v. Madanlal,26 submit that in cases of sexual offences, the concept of compromise,\\nespecially in the form of marriage between the accused and the prosecutrix shall not be thought of,\\nas any such attempt would be offensive to the woman„s dignity.\\nƒ18. €We would like to clearly state that in a case of rape or attempt of rape, the conception of\\ncompromise under no circumstances can really be thought of. These are crimes against the body of a\\nwoman which is her own temple. These are offences which suffocate the breath of life and sully the\\nreputation.

However, it is imperative to emphasize that we do not accept such\\ncompromise in matters relating to the offence of rape and similar cases of sexual assault. Hence, the\\naforesaid compromise is of no relevance in deciding this matter.

Empirically, the statistics regarding certain kinds of crimes against women have not shown any\\nsignificant decline. In states and union territories, 32033 rape cases (under Section 376 IPC) were\\nregistered in 2019; 4038 cases of attempt to rape were registered the same year (under Section 376\\nread with Section 511, IPC). As many as 88,387 cases under Section 354 IPC were registered the\\nsame year, whereas 6939 cases were registered under Section 509 (outraging the modesty of a\\nwoman) in 2019. In all, a total of 4, 05,861 crimes against women were reported in 2019 (as against\\n359849 in 2017 and 378236 in 2018). The statistic for a relatively new species of offensive activities,\\ncybercrimes that are women-centric, such as Transmitting of Sexually Explicit Material (Sec.\\n67A/67B, Information Technology Act), Blackmailing Defamation/Morphing/creating Fake Profile\\netc) registered in 2019, were 1645.

The role of all courts is to make sure that the survivor can rely on their impartiality and\\nneutrality, at every stage in a criminal proceeding, where she is the survivor and an aggrieved party.\\nEven an indirect undermining of this responsibility cast upon the court, by permitting discursive\\nformations on behalf of the accused, that seek to diminish his agency, or underplay his role as an\\nactive participant (or perpetrator) of the crime, could in many cases, shake the confidence of the\\nrape survivor (or accuser of the crime) in the impartiality of the court. The current attitude\\nregarding crimes against women typically is that ƒgrave□ offences like rape are not tolerable and\\noffenders must be punished. This, however, only takes into consideration rape and other serious\\nforms of gender-based physical violence. The challenges Indian women face are formidable: they\\ninclude a misogynistic society with entrenched cultural values and beliefs, bias (often\\nsub-conscious) about the stereotypical role of women, social and political structures that are heavily\\nmale- centric, most often legal enforcement structures that either cannot cope with, or are unwilling\\nto take strict and timely measures. Therefore, reinforcement of this stereotype, in court utterances\\nor orders, through considerations which are extraneous to the case, would impact fairness.\\n32. Academic writings highlight that a judgment at all levels has a number of distinct audiences,\\neach of which engages with it in a different way. The parties to the case and their counsel will be\\ninterested in how the judge resolves their specific dispute - what the law gives to or requires of them.\\nAt the same time, in a legal system where judgments of courts set precedents, and in particular\\nwithin a common law system, judgments have significance beyond their authoritative resolution of a\\nspecific dispute…particularly in the Supreme Court.

Using rakhi tying as a condition for bail, transforms a molester into a brother, by a judicial\\nmandate. This is wholly unacceptable, and has the effect of diluting and eroding the offence of\\nsexual harassment. The act perpetrated on the survivor constitutes an offence in law, and is not a\\nminor transgression that can be remedied by way of an apology, rendering community service, tying\\na rakhi or presenting a gift to the survivor, or even promising to marry her, as the case may be. The\\nlaw criminalizes outraging the modesty of a woman.

The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has noted that judicial stereotyping ƒis a\\ncommon and pernicious barrier to justice, particularly for women victims and survivors of violence.\\nSuch stereotyping causes judges to reach a view about cases based on preconceived beliefs, rather\\nthan relevant facts and actual enquiry.□30 Furthering of rape myths and stereotypes by the\\njudiciary, limits the emancipatory potential of the law.\\n35. ˆJudicial stereotyping„ refers to the practice of judges ascribing to an individual specific\\nattributes, characteristics or roles by reason only of her or his membership in a particular social\\ngroup (e.g. women).

Judges can play a significant role in ridding the justice system of harmful stereotypes. They have\\nan important responsibility to base their decisions on law and facts in evidence, and not engage in\\ngender stereotyping. This requires judges to identify gender stereotyping, and identify how the\\napplication, enforcement or perpetuation of these stereotypes discriminates against women or\\ndenies them equal access to justice. Stereotyping might compromise the impartiality of a judge„s\\ndecision and affect his or her views about witness credibility or the culpability of the accused\\nperson.36As a judge of the Canadian Supreme Court remarked:\\nƒMyths and stereotypes are a form of bias because they impair the individual judge„s\\nability to assess the facts in a particular case in an open-minded fashion.

The instances spelt out in the present judgment are only illustrations; the idea is that the\\ngreatest extent of sensitivity is to be displayed in the judicial approach, language and reasoning\\nadopted by the judge. Even a solitary instance of such order or utterance in court, reflects adversely\\non the entire judicial system of the country, undermining the guarantee to fair justice to all, and\\nespecially to victims of sexual violence (of any kind from the most aggravated to the so-called minor\\noffences).\\n44. Having regard to the foregoing discussion, it is hereby directed that henceforth:\\n(a) Bail conditions should not mandate, require or permit contact between the\\naccused and the victim. Such conditions should seek to protect the complainant from\\nany further harassment by the accused;\\n(b) Where circumstances exist for the court to believe that there might be a potential\\nthreat of harassment of the victim, or upon apprehension expressed, after calling for\\nreports from the police, the nature of protection shall be separately considered and\\nappropriate order made, in addition to a direction to the accused not to make any\\ncontact with the victim;Aparna Bhat vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 18 March, 2021\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13024806/ 15'),\n",

In other words, discussion about the dress,\\nbehavior, or past ƒconduct□ or ƒmorals□ of the prosecutrix, should not enter the\\nverdict granting bail;\\n(e) The courts while adjudicating cases involving gender related crimes, should not\\nsuggest or entertain any notions (or encourage any steps) towards compromises\\nbetween the prosecutrix and the accused to get married, suggest or mandate\\nmediation between the accused and the survivor, or any form of compromise as it is\\nbeyond their powers and jurisdiction;\\n(f) Sensitivity should be displayed at all times by judges, who should ensure that\\nthere is no traumatization of the prosecutrix, during the proceedings, or anything\\nsaid during the arguments, and\\n(g) Judges especially should not use any words, spoken or written, that would\\nundermine or shake the confidence of the survivor in the fairness or impartiality of\\nthe court.\\n45. Further, courts should desist from expressing any stereotype opinion, in words spoken during\\nproceedings, or in the course of a judicial order, to the effect that (i) women are physically weak and\\nneed protection; (ii) women are incapable of or cannot take decisions on their own; (iii) men are the\\nƒhead□ of the household and should take all the decisions relating to family; (iv) women should be\\nsubmissive and obedient according to our culture; (v) ƒgood□ women are sexually chaste; (vi)\\nmotherhood is the duty and role of every woman, and assumptions to the effect that she wants to be\\na mother; (vii) women should be the ones in charge of their children, their upbringing and care;\\n(viii) being alone at night or wearing certain clothes make women responsible for being attacked;\\n(ix) a woman consuming alcohol, smoking, etc. may justify unwelcome advances by men or ƒhas\\nasked for it□; (x) women are emotional and often overreact or dramatize events, hence it is necessary\\nto corroborate their testimony; (xi) testimonial evidence provided by women who are sexually active\\nmay be suspected when assessing ƒconsent□ in sexual offence cases; and (xii) lack of evidence of\\nphysical harm in sexual offence case leads to an inference of consent by the woman.\\n46. As far as the training and sensitization of judges and lawyers, including public prosecutors goes,\\nthis court hereby mandates that a module on gender sensitization be included, as part of the\\nfoundational training of every judge. This module must aim at imparting techniques for judges to be\\nmore sensitive in hearing and deciding cases of sexual assault, and eliminating entrenched social\\nbias, especially misogyny. The module should also emphasize the prominent role that judges are\\nexpected to play in society, as role models and thought leaders, in promoting equality and ensuringAparna Bhat vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 18 March, 2021\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13024806/ 16'),\n",

Such allegations\\nconstitute ingredients of cheating, causing damage to the Bank which was induced because of false\\nstatement made by DAIL and its officials. Mr. Tulsi has submitted that entrustment of physical\\npossession of the property is not essential for the offence defined in Section 405 IPC. The expression\\n\"whoever being in any manner entrusted with property or with any dominion over property\", clearly\\nnegatives the contention that since physical possession was not exclusively transferred to the Bank,\\nthere can not be a case of entrustment. If the offence under Section 405 IPC is interpreted in the\\naforesaid manner, it will open the flood gate for Bank frauds, corruption amongst public servants\\nand will endanger the smooth flow of trade and commerce.

At that stage, the High Court must accept\\neach of the allegations made in the FIR as correct on its face value for the purpose of\\ndetermining as to whether the ingredients of the offences alleged in the FIR are\\ncontained therein or not. Mr.Tulsi has submitted that the High Court has grossly\\nerred in quashing the complaints.

It has been contended by Mr.\\nTulsi that since the very definition of offence of criminal breach of trust is founded on\\nlegal contract touching upon the discharge of trust, almost every case of criminal\\nbreach of trust is bound to have an element of civil liability. Policy of the legislature\\nin enacting the offence under Section 405 IPC, therefore, is to treat the breach of\\ncontract in the matter of property which is entrusted as an aggravated civil wrong and\\nthereby constituting a criminal offence. That being the policy, to quash a FIR on the\\nground that a civil remedy has already been invoked would be destructive of the\\nobject of the legislation. In this connection, Mr. Tulsi has relied on the decision of\\nthis Court in Collector of Customs and Central Excise, Bhubneshwar, District Puri Vs.\\nParadip Port Trust and Another (1990 (4) SCC 205).

The grant of credit facility giving of a loan in pursuance of\\nthat credit facility cannot possibly amount to entrustment of property. A loan is quite\\ndifferent form entrustment of money. Similarly, when the debtor hypothecates his\\ngoods to Bank by way of security, there is no entrustment of those goods to the bank\\nby the debtor.

Before there can be any entrustment, the entrustment\\ncarries with it the implication that the person handing over any property or on whose\\nbehalf that property is handed over to another, continues to be its owner.

For\\nquashing the complaint by way of action at the threshold. It is, therefore, necessary to consider\\nwhether no the face of the allegations, a criminal offence is constituted or not. In recent decisions of\\nthis Court, the case of Bhajan Lal (supra), since relied on by Mr. Tulsi, the guiding principles in\\nquashing a criminal case have been indicated.\\nIn the instant case, a serious dispute has been raised by the learned counsel appearing for the\\nrespective party as to whether on the face of the allegations, an offence of criminal breach of trust is\\nconstituted or not. In our view, the expression 'entrusted with property' or 'with any dominion over\\nproperty' has been used in wide sense in Section 405 I.P.C. Such expression includes all case in\\nwhich goods are entrusted, that is, voluntarily handed over for a specific purpose and dishonestly\\ndisposed of in violation of law or in violation of contract. The expression 'entrusted appearing in\\nSection 405 I.P.C. is not necessarily a term of law. It has wide and different implication in different\\ncontext. It is, however, necessary that the ownership or beneficial interest in the ownership of the\\nproperty entrusted in respect of which offence is alleged to have been committed must be in some\\nperson other than the accused and the latter must hold it on account of some person or in some way\\nfor his benefit. The expression 'Trust' in Section 405 I.P.C. is a comprehensive expression and has\\nbeen used to denote various kinds of relationship like the relationship of trustee and beneficiary,\\nbailer and bailee, master and servant, pledger and pledger. When some goods are hypothecated by a\\nperson to another person. the ownership of the goods still remains with the person who has\\nhypothecated such goods. The property in respect of which criminal breach of trust can be\\ncommitted must necessarily be the property of some person other than the accused or the beneficial\\ninterest in or ownership of it must be in other person and the offender must hold such property in\\ntrust for such other person or for his benefit. In a case of pledge, the pledged article belongs to some\\nother person or for his benefit. In a case of Pledge, the pledged article belongs to some other person\\nbut the same is kept in trust by the pledgee. In the instant case, a floating charge was made on the\\ngoods by way of security to cover up credit facility. In our view, in such case for disposing of the\\ngoods covering the security to cover up credit facility. In our view, In such case for disposing of the\\ngoods covering the security to cover up credit facility. In our view, in such case for disposing of the\\ngoods covering the security against credit facility the offence of criminal breach of trust is not\\ncommitted. In the facts and circumstances of the case, it, however, appears to us that the\\nRespondents moved the High Court only in 1991 although the first Fir was filed in 1987 and the\\nsecond was filed in 1989. The CBI, therefore, Got sufficient time to complete the investigation for\\nthe purpose of framing the charge.\\nAlthough Mr. Tulsi, the learned Additional Solicitor General, is justified in his submission that a\\nparticular act may constitute both civil wrong as well as criminal wrong and merely because a civil\\naction is also pursued, it does not render the criminal action impermissible, in the facts of the case,\\nit appears to us that long after the completion of civil suits, the further investigation in connection\\nwith the complaints may not be expedient. It may be noted that the opinion given by the Senior\\nManager (Legal) that the credit facility which was given to DAIL for its tobacoo division should be\\ntransferred to the newly formed Company, namely, New Tabacoo Company Limited, cannot be held\\nto be per se malafide or illegal in vies of the provisions of Section 394 of the Companies Act.

Police on her\\ncomplaint conducted investigation and laid charge sheet against the appellant, who\\nhas filed this Criminal Appeal special leave as he did not succeed in his approach to\\nthe High court at the F.I.R. stage itself.\\nMore details of the case are these:\\nAppellant (Satish Mehra) and his wife (Anita Mehra) were living in New York ever\\nsince their marriage. They have three children among whom the eldest daughter\\n(Nikita) was born of 2nd April, 1988. Before and after the birth of the children\\nrelationship between husband and wife was far from cordial. Husband alleged that\\nhis wife, in conspiracy with her father, had siphoned off a whopping sum from his\\nbank deposits in India by forging his signature. He also alleged that his wife is\\nsuffering from some peculiar psychiatric condition. He approached a court at New\\nYork for securing custody of his children. On 31.10.1992 his wife left his house with\\nthe children and then filed a complaint with Saffolk County Police Station (United\\nStates) alleging that her husband had sexually abused Nikita who was then aged four.\\nUnited States police at the local level moved into action. But after conducting detailed\\ninvestigation concluded that the allegations of incestuous abuse are untrue.\\nOn 7.3.1993, appellant\\'s wife (Anita) returned to India with her children. In the\\nmeanwhile Family Court at New York has ordered that custody of the children be\\ngiven to the husband and a warrant of arrest was issued against Anita for\\nimplementation of the said order.\\nThe battle field between the parties was thereafter shifted to India as she came back\\nhome. On 19.3.1993, Anita filed a complaint to the \"Crime Against Women Cell\"\\n(CAW Cell for short) New Delhi in which she stated that her husband committed sex\\nabuses with Nikita while they were in United States and further alleged that appellant\\ncommitted certain matrimonial misdemeanour on his wife. But the complain was\\nclose but want of jurisdiction for the CAW Cell to investigate into what happened in\\nUnited States. Appellant returned to India on 127.1993 and thereafter filed a petition\\nfor a writ of Habeas Corpus for securing the custody of the children.\\nThe present case is based on a complaint filed by Anita before Greater Kailash Police\\nstation on 14.8.1993. FIR was prepared and a case was registered as Crime No.\\n197/93 for offences under Sections 354 and 498-A of Indian Penal Code. On\\n25.8.1993, the investigating officer moved the Sessions Court for adding Section 376\\nof the IPC also.

Learned Session judge, by a detailed order, found that no charge under\\nSection 498-A IPC could be framed against the appellant, but charge for offences\\nunder Sections 354 and 376 read with Section 511 of IPC should be framed against\\nhim. Accordingly, the charge has been framed with the said two counts.\\nFirst count in the charge is that appellant had outraged the modesty of his minor\\ndaughter aged about 3 years during some time between March and July, 1991 at D-\\n108, East of Kailash, New Delhi by fondling with her vagina and also by inserting\\nbottle into it and thereby committed the offence under Section 354 of the IPC. Second\\ncount in the charge is that he made an attempt to commit rape on the said infant\\nchild (time and place are the same) and thereby committed the offence under Section\\n376 read with Section 511 of the IPC.\\nAt this stage it is superfluous to consider whether the FIR is liable to be quashed as both sides\\nargued on the sustainability of the charge framed by the Sessions Judge. We are, therefore,\\nconsidering the main question whether the Sessions Court should have framed the charge against\\nthe appellant as it did now.\\nConsiderations which should weigh with the Sessions Court at this state have been well designed by\\nthe Parliament through Section 227 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short \\'the Code\\') which\\nreads thus:\\n\"227. Discharge. - If, upon consideration of the record of the case and the documents\\nsubmitted therewith, and after hearing the submissions of the accused and the\\nprosecution there is not sufficient ground for proceeding accused and record his\\nreasons for so doing.\"\\nSection 228 contemplates the stage after the case survives the stage envisaged in the former section.\\nWhen the Court is of opinion that there is ground to presume that the accused has committed and\\noffence the procedure laid down therein has to be adopted. When those two section are put\\njuxtaposition with each other the test to be adopted becomes discernible: Is there sufficient ground\\nfor proceeding against the accused? It is axiomatic that the standard of proof normally adhered to at\\nthe final stage is not to be applied at the stage where the scope of consideration is where there is\\n\"sufficient ground for proceeding\". (Vide State of Bihar v. Ramesh Singh, AIR 1977 SO 2018, and\\nSupdt, & Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, West Bengal v. Anil Kumar Bhunja, 1979 Cr. L.J. 1390:\\nAIR 1980 SC 52).\\nIn Alamohan Das v. State of West Bengal (AIR 1970 SC\\n863) Shah, j. (as he then was) has observed in the context of considering the scope of committal\\nproceedings under Section 209 of the old Code of Criminal Procedure (1898) that a Judge can sift\\nand weight the materials on record by seeing whether there is sufficient evidence for commitment.

Of course the exercise is to find out whether a prima facie case\\nagainst the accused has been made out.\\nIn Union of India v. Profullakumar- 1979 Cr.L.J. 154, this Court has observed that the Judge while\\nconsidering the question of framing the charge has \"the undoubted power to sift and wight the\\nevidence for the limited purpose of finding out whether a prima facie case against the accused has\\nbeen made out\". However, there Lordships pointed out that the test to determine a prima facie case\\nwould naturally dependent upon the facts of each case and it is difficult to lay down a rule of\\nuniversal application. \"By and large, however, if who view are equally possible and the Judge is\\nsatisfied that the evidence produced before him gives rise to some suspicion but not grave\\nsuspension, the Judge would be fully within his right to discharge the accused\". At the same time the\\nCourt cautioned that a roving enquiry into the pros and cons of the case by weighing the evidence as\\nif he was conducting the trial is not expected or even warranted at this stage.\\nAn incidental question which emerges in this context is whether the Session Judge can look into any\\nmaterial other than those produced by the prosecution. Section 226 of the Code obliges the\\nprosecution to describe the charge brought against the accused and to state by what evidence the\\nguilt of the accused would be proved. The Next provisions enjoins on the Session Judge to decide\\nwhether there is sufficient ground to proceed against the accused. In so deciding the Judge has to\\nconsider (1) the record of the case and (2) the documents produced therewith. He has then to hear\\nthe submissions of the accused as well as the prosecution on the limited question whether there is\\nsufficient ground to proceed. What is the scope of hearing the submissions? Should it be confined to\\nhearing oral arguments alone?\\nSimilar situation arise under Section 239 of the Code (which deals with trial of warrant cases on\\npolice report). In that situation the Magistrate has to afford the prosecution and the accused an\\nopportunity of being heard besides considering the police report and the documents sent therewith.\\nAt these two State the Code enjoins on the Court to give audience to the accused for deciding\\nwhether it is necessary to proceed to the next State. It is a matter of exercise of judicial mind. There\\nis nothing in the code which shrinks the scope of such audience to oral arguments. If the accused\\nsucceeds in producing any reliable material at that stage which might fatally affect even the very\\nsustainability of the case, it is unjust to suggest that no such material shall be looked into by the\\nCourt at that stage. Here the \"ground\" may be any valid ground including insufficiency of evidence\\nto prove charge.\\nThe object of providing such an opportunity as is envisaged in Section 227 of the code is to enable\\nthe Court to decide whether it is necessary to proceed to conduct the trial. If the case ends there it\\ngains a lot of time of the Court and saves much human efforts and cost. If the materials produced by\\nthe accused even at that early stage would clinch the issue, why should the Court shut it out saying\\nthat such documents need be produced only after wasting a lot more time in the name of trial\\nproceedings. Hence, we are of the view that Sessions Judge would be within his powers to consider\\neven material which the accused may produce at the stage contemplated in Section 227 of the Code.Sh.

We are under heavy\\npressure of work-load. If the Sessions Judge is almost certain that the trial would only be an exercise\\nin futility or a sheer waste of time it is advisable to truncate or ship the proceedings at the stage of\\nSection 227 of the Code itself.\\nIn the present case learned Session Judge has missed certain germane aspects. Apart form the\\nseemingly incredulous nature of the accusations against a father that he molested his infant child\\n(who would have just passed her suckling stage the) the Sessions Judge out not to have overlooked\\nthe following telling circumstances.\\nThe complaint made by her with the New York police that her husband committed sexual offences\\nagainst her 18 months old female child was investigated by the New York police and found the\\ncomplaint bereft of truth hook, line and sinker. The present charge is that the appellant committed\\nsuch offences against the same child at East Kailash, New Delhi some time during March to July,\\n1991. There is now no case of what happened in United States. There is now no case of what\\nhappened in United States. The Sessions Judge should have noted that appellant\\'s wife has not even\\nremotely alleged in the complaint filed by her on 19.3.1993 before CAW Cell , New Delhi that\\nappellant has done anything like that while he was in India. Even the other complaint. petition (on\\nwhich basis the FIR was prepared) is totally silent about a case that appellant did anything against\\nhis daughter anywhere in India. when we perused the statement of Anita Mehra (second\\nrespondent) we felt no doubt that the has been brimming with acerbity towards the petitioner on\\naccount of other causes. She describes her marital life with petitioner as \\'extremely painful and\\nunhappy from the very inception\". She complains that petitioner has \"a history of irrational\\noutbursts of temper and violence\". She accused him of being alcoholic and prone to inflicting server\\nphysical violence on her form 1980 onwards.\\nThus her attitude to the petitioner, even de hors the allegation involving the child, was vengeful. We\\ntake into account the assertion of the of the petitioner that the present story involving Nikita was\\nconcocted by the second respondent to wreak her vengeance by embroiling him in serious criminal\\ncases in India so that the could be nailed down here and prevent him from going back to U.S.A.\\nWhile hearing the arguments we ascertained whether the spouses could settle their differences.\\nSecond respondent, who to was present in court, made an offer through her counsel that she could\\nagree for annulling the criminal proceedings against the petitioner on the condition that he should\\nwithdraw his claims on the bank deposits and would also relinquish his claim for custody of the\\nchildren, and further he should concede for a divorce.

To substantiate this allegation he drew our\\nattention to the U.S. police report, in which there is mention of a medical examination conducted on\\nNikita by a U.S. doctor (Dr. Gordon) on 24.11.92. That doctor pointed out that there was absolutely\\nno indication of any sexual abuse when the child was physically examined. If the medical\\nexamination done on the child in November, 1992 showed such normal condition, petitioner posed\\nthe question -who would have meddled with the child\\'s genitals before 26.7.93, to case such a\\nwidening of the vaginal office? (We now remember again that, as per present case, the last occasion\\nwhen the petitioner should have abused the child was in July, 1991). The aforesaid question, posed\\nby the petitioner in the context of expressing grave concern over what the mother might do with the\\nlittle female child for creating evidence of sex abuse, cannot be sideline by us in considering whether\\nthe case should proceed to the trial stage.\\nPetitioner invited out attention to the answers which Mrs. Veena Sharma (of CAWC) has elicited\\nfrom Nikita, a verbatim reproduction of which is given in the counter affidavit filed by the second\\nrespondent. The said interrogation record reveals that Mrs. Veena Sharma has practically put on the\\ntongue of the little girl that her father had molested her. The following questions and answers can\\nbring the point home the questions. The questioner asked the child \"what your dady did with you\"\\nand the child answered that he put his finger (and showed her private part). Not being satisfied with\\nthe answer the next question put to the child was \"Dady puts what else\". Then Nikita answers \"Dady\\nputs his bottle\". We noticed with disquiet that the questioner drew the picture of the petitioner -face\\nbody and then asked certain questions such as \"where is papa\\'s bottle? Is it on the cupboard?\" The\\nchild kept looking at the drawn sketch and pointed to the part between legs. Questioner then asked\\nif anything was missing in the picture, to which Nikita Answered \"glesses\". After the child again\\npointed to the private parts between the legs, the questioner wanted the child to draw \"papa\\'s\\nbottle\". But then the child told her \"you do it.\" The questioner at the stage had the temerity to draw\\nthe picture of the private parts of child\\'s father. We are much disturbed at the manner in which the\\nlittle child was interrogated by the said officer of CAW Cell. At any rate we have no doubt that the\\npurpose of such questions was to lead the child unmistakably to the tutored answers.\\nEven overlooking all the inherent infirmities shrouding the testimony of a tiny tot speaking about\\nwhat her further did when she was aged 3 and even ignoring the appellant\\'s persistent submission\\nthat the little child was briskly tutored by her mother to speak to the present version, There is no\\nreasonable prospect of the sessions court relaying on such a testimony to reach the conclusion that\\nthe prosecution succeeded in proving the offence charged beyond all reasonable doubt.\\nOver and above that, what would be the consequence if this nebulous allegation is allowed to\\nproceed to the trial stage. We foresee that Nikita, the child witness, now eight years and four month\\nold, mus necessarily be subjected to cross-questions involving sex and sex organs. The traumatic\\nimpact on the child when she would be confronted by volley of questions dealing with such a subject\\nis a matter of concerned to us.

The husband at that time was an army officer. He retired\\nand Lt. Colonel on August 10, 1986. On September 28, 1989 he filed the petition for divorce against\\nhis wife under Section 13 of the Act on the alleged grounds of cruelty and desertion. He stated that\\nwithin two years of the marriage the wife started creating problem for him and she persisted in her\\nbehaviour right till the year 1989. In this span of 26 years in their married life, they have become the\\nparents of four children, two sons and two daughters.

Husband says that being head of the family he is to maintain two\\nsons and a daughter as they are dependent on him. His claim is that he is presently having a meagre\\nsalary of Rs. 5000/- per month and is employed as consultant/adviser with M/s. Mukul\\nInternational Private Limited.

After deduction of income-tax at source, husband says he is getting an amount of Rs.\\n4700/- per month. Husband admits that he has a house in NOIDA which was on rent with the army\\nand lease was terminated by letter dated January 29, 1996 from the Ministry of Defence. He says\\nrepairs are being carried on in the house and presently he is living with her eldest son in his house.\\nHe further says he is not getting any pension as on his permanent absorption in ONGC, he had\\nopted to receive lumpsum amount in lieu of pension and prorata gratuity amount in lieu of pension\\nand prorata gratuity amounting to Rs. 2,60,456/-. In addition the husband also received an amount\\nof Rs. 55,775/- on account of D.C.R. Gty. Husband has also filed his computation of taxable income\\nfor the assessment years 1992- 93, 1995-96 and 1996-97. He has though not filed any assessment\\norder. Since he retired from ONGC in August, 1995 it would be appropriate to see his computation\\nof taxable income for the year ending March 31, 1995. His gross salary income in Rs. 1,88,281/- and\\nafter deduction of House Rent Allowance it comes to Rs. 1,78,614. Income from house property he\\nsay is Rs. 22716/-, interest income is Rs. 3179/-. Total of these three items would be Rs. 2,04,509/-.\\nThen there are claims of standard deduction, repairs in the house and tax rebate on saving\\namounting to Rs. 68,922/- which include payment on account of LIC, PF, PPF, MEP, NSC and\\ngeneral insurance. The amount of tax payable comes to Rs. 35716/- on a taxable income of Rs.\\n1,81,790/-. For the assessment year 1996-97 (year ending on March 31, 1996) the salary income\\nshown is 1,18,151/-, income from house property is Rs. 18, 930/- and after standard deduction, and\\nother deduction and the rebate the income tax payable is Rs. 18, 464/- on the net income of Rs.\\n1,31,200/-.\\nWife says that the husband has not given true account of his assets and income and has rather\\nsuppressed the same.

The fact remains that the wife has no source of income and\\nshe is also maintaining her eldest unmarried daughter. Under the Hindu Adoptions & Maintenance\\nAct, 1956 it is the obligation of a person to maintain her unmarried daughter if she is unable to\\nmaintain herself. In this case since the wife has no income of her own, it is the obligation of the\\nhusband to maintain her and her two unmarried daughters one of whom is living with wife and one\\nwith him. Section 24 of the Act no doubt talks of maintenance of wife during the pendency of the\\nproceedings but this section, in our view, cannot be read in isolation and cannot be given restricted\\nmeaning to hold that it is maintenance of the wife alone and no one else. Since wife is maintaining\\nthe eldest unmarried daughter, her right to claim maintenance would include her own maintenance\\nand that of her daughter. This fact has to be kept in view while fixing the maintenance pendente lite\\nfor the wife. We are aware of the provisions of Section 26 of the Act providing for custody of minor\\nchildren, their maintenance and education but that section operates in its own field.Smt.

On one date when this appeal came up for hearing we were told that\\nthe husband had left that morning itself for Canada for further treatment after his bypass surgery in\\nIndia and that his expenses visiting the Canada and as well as the expenses for the treatment there\\nwere being met by his friend. In his affidavit husband has stated that his friend Sontosh Singh for\\nhis treatment in Canada paid his fare. He is, however, silent about the expense if any met by Sontosh\\nSingh for his treatment in Canada. A copy of the statutory declaration of Sontosh Singh which is\\ndated March 21, 1997 has also been filed. In this Sontosh Singh does say that he has undertaken to\\nbear the cost of passage and maintenance of respondent during his stay in Canada and North\\nAmerica. It is a matter of common knowledge that medical treatment in Canada is high and an\\nordinary person cannot afford the expenses which are met by taking medical insurance. As to what\\nexpenses husband incurred for his bypass surgery in India has not been disclosed. On our query as\\nto how much foreign exchange husband obtained while going to Canada, it was stated that Dollar\\nU.S. 1,350 were obtained at a cost of about Rs. 50,000/-. From where all these monies came from\\nwe are left in dark. Husband had not filed any certificate of his salary from his present employer\\nthough the wife has contended that both the firms Mukul Overseas Pvt. Ltd and Mukul International\\nPvt. Ltd. are owned by the husband himself which fact husband had denied. Though we are not\\nconcerned with the income of his son which is stated to be Rs. 7,500/- per month, it would have\\nbeen better if the husband had given complete details as to the perquisites enjoyed by his son, the\\nrent he is paying for his rented accommodation at Safdarjung Enclave and the like. Claim of the\\nhusband that though his house in NOIDA fell vacant in January, 1996, it has neither been further let\\nnor the husband himself living there because of certain repairs and on that account he is residing\\nwith his son does not appeal to us. It does appear to us from the affidavit of the husband that it\\nconceals more than what it tells of his income and other assets. Attempt has been made to conceal\\nhis true income and that leads us to draw an adverse inference against the husband about his\\nincome that it is much more than what is being disclosed to us. The claim of the husband that from\\nan income of Rs. 4,750/- per month which is getting from Mukul International Pvt. Ltd. he has to\\nmaintain himself, his two sons and daughter is absorb particularly when the eldest son is earning\\nmore than the husband and it is the husband who is living with him. Husband has also not disclosed\\nretrial benefits if any from the ONGC and the amount of provident fund he obtained from there.\\nHusband has interest income from Unit Trust of India and also from the fixed deposit receipt but\\nagain he has not disclosed the number of units he is holding and the amount of the fixed deposits in\\nhis name, from all these we have to hold that the annual income of the respondent-husband is even\\non modest estimate to be Rs. 2,40,000/- annually which would come to Rs. 20,000/- per month.\\nConsidering the diverse claims made by the parties one inflating the income and the other\\nsuppressing an element of conjecture and guess work does enter for arriving at the income of the\\nhusband.

Amount of maintenance fixed for the wife should be such as she can live in reasonable\\ncomfort considering her status and the mode of life she was used to when she lived with her\\nhusband and also that she does not feel handicapped in the prosecution of her case. At the same\\ntime, the amount so fixed cannot be excessive or extortionate. In the circumstances of the present\\ncase we fix maintenance pendente lite at the rate of Rs. 5,000/- per month payable by\\nrespondent-husband to the appellant-wife.\\nThe question then arises as to from which date the wife would be entitled to claim the enhanced\\namount of maintenance pendente lite. If wife has no source of income it is the obligation of the\\nhusband to maintain her and also children of the marriage on the basis of the provision contained in\\nthe Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956. Her right to claim maintenance fructifies on the\\ndate of the filing of the petition for divorce under the Act. Having thus fixed the date as the filing of\\nthe petition for divorce it is not always that the court has to grant the maintenance from that date.\\nThe court has discretion in the matter as to from which date maintenance under Section 24 of the\\nAct should be granted. The discretion of the court would depend upon multiple circumstance which\\nare to be kept in view. These could be the time taken to serve the respondent in the petition the date\\nof filing of the application under Section 241 of the Act; conduct of the parties in the proceedings;\\naverments made in the application and the reply there to; the tendency of the wife to inflate the\\nincome out of all proportion and that of the husband to suppress the same; and the like. There has\\nto be honesty of purpose for both the parties which unfortunately we find lacking in this case. We\\nare therefore of the opinion that ends of justice would be met if we direct that maintenance\\npendente lite as fixed by this judgment to be payable from the date of impugned order of the High\\nCourt which is October 16, 1996. We order accordingly. The impugned judgment of the High Court\\nshall stand modified to that extent.

An Executive Magistrate Syed Ejaj Ahmad (PW-3) was called for exhumation of the dead body. He\\nasked a doctor to conduct exhumation proceeding.

We will hereinafter notice the circumstances which existed in establishing the commission of the\\ncrime.\\n34. PW-5 Sabah Khaleeli, was the daughter of the deceased through her first husband. She in her\\ndeposition categorically stated that she had spoken to her mother on 19.04.1991. She was not\\navailable on phone from May, 1991 onwards. Gauhar Namazee (PW-25) was the mother of the\\ndeceased. She in her deposition stated that she had last seen the deceased on 13.04.1991. She had\\nnot been cross-examined on the said point. It is also not disputed that PW-18 and PW-19, who were\\nhusband and wife, were engaged by the deceased. They saw the deceased in the company of the\\nappellant in the morning of 28.05.1991, for the last time. The said witnesses were staying in a\\nservant quarter in the said premises. PW-18 was working as gardener-cum-handyman; whereas\\nPW-19 was working as maid servant, since 1988. They stated in unison that they had seen the\\ndeceased at about 07.30 A.M. on that day. According to PW-19, she went to the kitchen to prepare\\ntea for the couple and kept the tea cups on the dining table. She in no uncertain terms stated that the\\ncups of tea were taken by the appellant to the bed-room where the deceased was reading a\\nnewspaper. PW-19 while sweeping the house was called by the deceased and was instructed to clean\\nthe articles kept in the showcase instead of sweeping. They, however, received a telegram at about\\n10.00 a.m. whereby they were informed that the sister-in-law of PW-19 was sick at Gudisuvarapally\\nin the State of Andhra Pradesh. They sought for leave and some money. They were permitted to\\nleave Bangalore and were asked to collect the requisite amount after some time. They came back to\\ntheir quarters and started packing their goods. At about 1.30 p.m. they went back to the house.\\nPW-18, however, was said to have been asked by the appellant herein to shift a wooden box kept in\\nthe guest house to the bed room before leaving. They together with some others took a large wooden\\nbox from the guest house and kept the same inside the bed room, where they found the deceased\\nsleeping on the bed. They were thereafter paid a sum of Rs.1,200/- towards their salary and\\nadditional sum of Rs.500/- towards travelling expenses. They left for their home. They came back\\nafter a couple of days, but did not find the deceased. The said two witnesses in their depositions\\ncorroborated each other.\\n35. We have noticed hereinbefore that the appellant had applied for grant of anticipatory bail in\\nJuly, 1992 i.e. after the missing complaint was filed by PW-5. In the said application for bail, the\\nappellant himself disclosed that the deceased had left for unknown destination in the month of May,\\n1991, allegedly because of her agitated mental condition.\\n36. If it is proved that the deceased died in an unnatural circumstance in her bed room, which was\\noccupied only by her and her husband, law requires the husband to offer an explanation in this\\nbehalf. We, however, do not intend to lay down a general law in this behalf as much would depend\\nupon the facts and circumstances of each case. Absence of any explanation by the husband would\\nlead to an inference which would lead to a circumstance against the accused.\\n37.

The house of the accused, according\\nto plan PM, consists of one residential room one other small room and a varandah.\\nThe correctness of that plan is proved by A. R. Verma overseer (PW 5). The fact that\\nthe accused alone was with Churi deceased in the house when she was murdered\\nthere with the Khokhri and the fact that the relations of the accused with the\\ndeceased, as would be shown hereafter, were strained would, in the absence of any\\ncogent explanation by him, point to his guilt.\"\\nIn Trimukh Maroti Kirkan v.

We have noticed hereinbefore as to why the investigation was taken over by the Central Crime\\nBranch. As the interrogation of the appellant, while in custody of the police, revealed the possibility\\nof the deceased having been buried in the backyard of her residential house, the Investigating\\nOfficer requested the Sub-Divisional Magistrate to conduct exhumation proceedings, who in turn,\\nauthorized the Taluka Executive Magistrate (PW-3) to do so. Confession of the accused was not\\nadmissible in evidence. What was admissible only was that part of the confession leading to the\\ndiscovery of fact in terms of Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act.

In such a situation, in our view, nobody except the person\\nwho buried the box could have the knowledge of its burial.\"\\n39.

An attempt was made by the Bombay High Court to take a different view in Shri Shankar Gopal\\nPatil & Others v. The State of Maharashtra [2000 (5) Bom. CR 360].\\n43.

State of Maharashtra [(1969) 2 SCC 872], Shamshuk Kanwar v.\\nState of U.P. [(1995) 4 SCC 430] and State of Maharasthra v. Damu [(2000) 6 SCC 269], wherein\\nthis Court reiterated it with approval.\\n44. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, in our opinion, was not correct to\\ncontend that only because the investigating team having regard to the purported confession made by\\nthe appellant had already known that a dead body had been buried in the house, Section 27 of the\\nEvidence Act would not be attracted. In his statements before the investigating officer, he made a\\nconfession; but what was admissible in evidence his only that part which would come within the\\npurview of Section 27 of the Evidence Act and not the rest. The court while analyzing the evidence\\nand appreciating the same cannot take note of confession made before the police.\\n45. The prosecution case must rest on the other materials brought before the court. It is also not\\npermissible to start with the confession and find corroborative evidence thereof and come back to\\nthe confession again for the purpose of arriving at a conclusion of guilt.\\n46. What was, therefore, relevant for the purpose of Section 27 of the Evidence Act was that at the\\ninstance of the appellant himself a particular place which had been pin pointed by him had been dug\\nand remains of a body and other articles were recovered.\\n47. The various circumstances leading to the pointing out the guilt of the appellant and appellant\\nalone have been enumerated by us hereinbefore. From our discussions, it is evident that each of the\\ncircumstances had been established, the cumulative effect whereof would show that all the links in\\nthe chain are complete and the conclusion of the guilt is fully established.\\n48. We are not oblivious of the fact that there is a material difference distance between \\'may be\\' and\\n\\'must be\\' and furthermore in a case of this nature the evidence must be considered with more than\\nordinary care lest the shocking nature of crime induce an instinctive reaction against a dispassionate\\njudicial scrutiny of the facts and law. [See Kashmira Singh v. State of Madhya Pradesh - AIR 1952 SC\\n159].\\n49. The question, however, is as to whether in a case of this nature death sentence should be\\nimposed.

This Court had also the occasion therein to notice the growing demand in the international fora\\nand in particular the second Optional Protocol to the International Covenants on Civil and Political\\nRights and the Protocol to the American Constitution on Human Rights abolished that death\\npenalty should be abolished.\\n51. Recently, the Privy Council in Reyes v. R. [(2002) UKPC 11 : 12 BHRC 219] and Hughes, R. v.\\n(Saint Lucia) [(2002) UKPC 12], noticing the decision of this Court in Mithu v. State of Punjab\\n[(1983) 2 SCR 6903], opined that the mandatory death punishment is unconstitutional. [See also\\nFox v. The Queen (2002) 2 AC 284, Bowe v. The Queen (2006) 1 WLR 1623 and Coard & Ors. v. The\\nAttorney General (Grenada), (2007) UKPC 7].\\n52. Abolition of death penalty is not being and, in fact, cannot be advocated; but what requires\\nserious consideration is as to whether the jurisdiction should not be invoked unless there exists an\\nextra-ordinary situation to find that it comes within the purview of \"rarest of rare\" cases. The\\napproach of the courts should not be to confine its thought process to the identification of a \"rare\"\\ncase. The expression \"rarest of rare\" case has been evolved by a Constitution Bench of this Court\\nand, thus, demands a meaningful application.\\n53. It is interesting to note that Bhagwati, J. in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab [(1982) 3 SCC 24],\\nwhile expressing his dissenting opinion, noticed as under :\\n\"□This arbitrariness in the imposition of death penalty is considerably accentuated by\\nthe fragmented Bench structure of our courts where Benches are inevitably formed\\nwith different permutations and combinations from time to time and cases relating to\\nthe offence of murder come up for hearing sometimes before one Bench, sometimes\\nbefore another sometimes before a third and so on. Professor Blackshield has in his\\narticle on Capital Punishment in India published in Volume 21 ot the Journal of the\\nIndian Law Institute□ pointed out how the practice of Bench formation contributes to\\narbitrariness in the imposition of death penalty. It is well known that so far as the\\nSupreme Court is concerned, while the number of Judges has increased over the\\nyears, the number of Judges on Benches which hear capital punishment cases has\\nactually decreased. Most cases are now heard by two-Judge Benches. Professor\\nBlackshield has abstracted 70 cases in which the Supreme Court had to choose\\nbetween life and death while sentencing an accused for the offence of murder and\\nanalysing these 70 cases he has pointed out that during the period April 28, 1972 to\\nMarch 8, 1976 only 11 Judges of the Supreme Court participated in 10 per cent or\\nmore of the cases. He has listed these 11 Judges in an ascending order of leniency\\nbased on the proportion for each Judge of plus votes (i.e. votes for the death\\nsentence) to total votes and pointed out that these statistics show how the judicial\\nresponse to the question of life and death varies from judge to judge. It is significant\\nto note that out of 70 cases analysed by Professor Blackshield, 37 related to the\\nperiod subsequent to the coming into force of Section 354, sub-section (3) of theSwamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 14'),\n",

If a similar exercise is performed with reference to\\ncases decided by the Supreme Court after March 8, 1976, that being the date up to\\nwhich the survey carried out by Professor Blackshield was limited, the analysis will\\nreveal the same pattern of incoherence and arbitrariness, the decision to kill or not to\\nkill being guided to a large extent by the composition of the Bench. Take for example\\nRajendra Prasad case decided on February 9, 1979. In this case, the death sentence\\nimposed on Rajendra Prasad was commuted to life imprisonment by a majority\\nconsisting of Krishna Iyer, J. and Desai, J., A.P. Sen, J. dissented and was of the view\\nthat the death sentence should be confirmed. Similarly in one of the cases before us,\\nnamely, Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, when it was first heard by a Bench\\nconsisting of Kailasam and Sarkaria, JJ., Kailasam, J. was definitely of the view that\\nthe majority decision in Rajendra Prasad case9 was wrong and that is why he referred\\nthat case to the Constitution Bench. So also in Dalbir Singh v. State of Punjab, the\\nmajority consisting of Krishna Iyer, J. and Desai, J. took the view that the death\\nsentence imposed on Dalbir Singh should be commuted to life imprisonment while\\nA.P. Sen, J. stuck to the original view taken by him in Rajendra Prasad case9 and was\\ninclined to confirm the death sentence, It will thus be seen that the exercise of\\ndiscretion whether to inflict death penalty or not depends to a considerable extent on\\nthe value system and social philosophy of the Judges constituting the Bench□\"\\n54. We are not oblivious of a line of decisions of this Court where the doctrine of proportionality has\\nbeen applied, even in the matter of awarding death penalty. [See State of Rajasthan v. Kheraj Ram,\\n(2003) 8 SCC 224, Bablu @ Mubarik Hussain v. State of Rajasthan, 2006 (14) SCALE 15 and Shivu\\nand Anr. v. R.G. High Court of Karnataka and Anr. 2007 (3) SCALE 157]\\n55. In this case we need not go into the correctness or otherwise of the said view. Although it is also\\nnot necessary to do so, we may notice some development of law in this regard.\\n56. Criminal Justice Act 1991 of England famously hailed doctrine of proportionality as the guiding\\nprinciple. But since the 1991 legislation, field of sentencing has seen much reform and Criminal\\nJustice Act of 2003 presents a fresh set of sentencing objectives. Section 142 of the Act delineates\\nthe following as the purposes of sentencing:\\n\"142 Purposes of sentencing (1) Any court dealing with an offender in respect of his\\noffence must have regard to the following purposes of sentencing-\\n(a) the punishment of offenders,\\n(b) the reduction of crime (including its reduction by deterrence),\\n(c) the reform and rehabilitation of offenders,\\n(d) the protection of the public, andSwamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 15'),\n",

In this context it, a reference should also be made of the Halliday Report of 2001 (Making\\nPuncishments Work) which has some interesting insights to offer on the sentencing structure in\\nEngland and Wales. In the same vein, a White Paper in 2002 has made a case of reforms and\\nsuggested a shift from the proportionality principle.\\n58. In fine, scholarship on sentencing which has been quite diverse in its prescriptions certainly has\\nconsensus on the point that any decision on sentencing aspect would require assessing more than\\none variables and single minded pursuit of any one sentencing ideal would be discounting on other\\nequally urgent parameters and objectives.\\n59. We do not have a sentencing policy, unlike some other countries. England has the concept of\\n\"guideline judgments\" which is considered as a judge managed sentencing model rather than a\\nstatute induced one. Section 354 (3) suggests that Indian law furthers statute induced sentencing\\nguidance in part. Therefore it has to be given full colour.\\n60. We have no practice of referring such matters to superior courts for laying down the guidelines\\nrelating to imposition of sentence under various situations. [See The Queen v. Julie McGinley and\\nMichael Monaghan, (2003) NICC 1]\\n61. In our country, therefore, each case may have to be considered on its own merit.\\n62. It may be of some interest to note that Furman v. Georgia [408 U.S. 238 (1972)] ruled on the\\nrequirement for a degree of consistency in the application of the death penalty.\\nJustice Stewart held that:\\n\"The penalty of death differs from all other forms of criminal punishment, not in\\ndegree, but in kind. It is unique in its total irrevocability. It is unique in its rejection\\nof rehabilitation of the convict as a basic purpose of criminal justice. And it is unique,\\nfinally, in its absolute renunciation of all that is embodied in our concept of\\nhumanity.\\n*** *** *** These death sentences are cruel and unusual in the same way that being\\nstruck by lightning is cruel and unusual. For, of all the people convicted of rapes and\\nmurders in 1967 and 1968, many just as reprehensible as these, the petitioners are\\namong a capriciously selected random handful upon whom the sentence of death has\\nin fact been imposed.\"\\n63.

Indeed, the very words \"cruel\\nand unusual punishments\" imply condemnation of the arbitrary infliction of severe\\npunishments.\"\\n64. It is important to refer to Harbans Singh v. Union of India [AIR 1982 SC 849] at this juncture. In\\nthat case three people were sentenced to death by the trial court for playing an equal part in jointly\\nmurdering a family of four persons. The sentence of all the three was confirmed by the High Court.\\nEach of them moved to the Supreme Court by different Special Leave Petitions before three separate\\nbenches. One of the accused\\'s petition was dismissed and he was actually executed. Another\\'s\\npetition was allowed and his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. And the petition\\nof the third one was also dismissed. He filed a review petition, which was also dismissed, and the\\nExecutive refused clemency. He then moved another petition before the Supreme Court bringing to\\nlight this arbitrariness. The Supreme Court recommended the President to commute his sentence.\\nChandrachud J. while lamenting the death of dead accused said:\\n\"The fate of Jeeta Singh has a posthumous moral to tell. He cannot profit by the\\ndirection which we propose to give because he is now beyond the process of human\\ntribunals.\"\\n65. Bentham\\'s discourse on determination of minimum punishment and maximum punishment\\nserves as a yardstick in this context. Bentham in his landmark treatise Principles of Penal Law\\npropose to establish a proportion between crimes and punishments. But he cautions against an\\noracular understanding than an instructive one. We here further go in the details of what doctrine of\\nproportionality holds in the realm of sentencing. The first rule of proportionality mandates:\\n\"The value of the punishment must not be less in any case than what is sufficient to\\noutweigh that of the profit of the offence.\"\\nWhile talking of minimum punishment Bentham observes:\\n\"Punishments may be too small or too great; and there are reasons for not making\\nthem too small, as well as not making them too great. The terms minimum and\\nmaximum may serve to mark the two extremes of this question, which require equal\\nattention.\\nWith a view of marking out the limits of punishment on the side of the first of these\\nextremes, we may lay it down as a rule:□ That the value of the punishment must not\\nbe less in any case than what is sufficient to outweigh that of the profit of the offence.Swamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 17'),\n",

It is to be appreciated here that statutorily decided minimum sentence takes into account the\\nbasic value of the crime and suffice to outweigh the profit of the offence. The moot question relates\\nto parameters to decide the maximum punishment. Setting the trail of caution on the side of\\ndetermination of maximum punishment Bentham posits:\\n\"Punishment, whatever shape it may assume, is an evil...\\nThe minimum of punishment is more clearly marked than its maximum. What is too\\nlittle is more clearly observed than what is too much. What is not sufficient is easily\\nseen, but it is not possible so exactly to distinguish an excess. An approximation only\\ncan be attained. The irregularities in the force of temptations, compel the legislator to\\nincrease his punishments till they are not merely sufficient to restrain the ordinary\\ndesires of men; but also the violence of their desires when unusually excited.\\nThe greatest danger lies in an error on the minimum side, because in this case the\\npunishment is inefficacious; but this error is least likely to occur, a slight degree of\\nattention sufficing for its escape; and when it does exist, it is at the same time clear\\nand manifest, and easy to be remedied. An error on the maximum side, on the\\ncontrary, is that to which legislators and men in general are naturally\\ninclined□antipathy, or a want of compassion for individuals who are represented as\\ndangerous and vile, pushes them onward to an undue severity. It is on this side\\ntherefore, that we should take the most preparations, as on this side there has been\\nshown the greatest disposition to err.\"\\n67. On the same point Beccaria in his historic work Of Crimes and Punishments denounced\\nretributive basis of punishment.\\n\"The aim of punishment can only be to prevent the criminal committing new crimes\\nagainst his countrymen, and to keep others from doing likewise. Punishments,\\ntherefore, and the method of inflicting them, should be chosen in due proportion to\\nthe crime so as to make the most efficacious and lasting impression on the minds of\\nmen, and the least painful impressions on the body of the criminal.\\nFor a punishment to be efficacious, it is enough that the disadvantage of the\\npunishment should exceed the advantage anticipated from the crime; in which excess\\nshould be calculate the certainty of punishment and the loss of the expected benefit.\\nEverything beyond this, accordingly, is superfluous, and therefore tyrannical.\"\\n68. There is a clear and discernible necessity of caution to set the maximum punishment in an\\noffence. And also by implication there must be intensive and exhaustive inquiry into accused relatedSwamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 18'),\n",

Therefore discretion to the\\njudiciary in this respect (to declare the maximum punishment) is of utmost critical and seminal\\nvalue. Reasons must be detailed setting clearly why any punishment other than the maximum\\npunishment will not suffice. This is a general and age-old rule of sentencing which has been\\nstatutorily recognized under section 354(3).\\n69. Reference to the decision of other jurisdictions and/or the recent trend in the international fora\\nhas not been referred to by way of precedents or even a persuasive value but the court in this age\\ncannot afford to put down blinkers on its window to the outside world.\\n70. It is noteworthy to mention here the Law Commission in its Report of 1967 took the view that\\ncapital punishment acted as a deterrent to crime. While it conceded that statistics did not prove\\nthese so-called deterrent effects. It also said that figures did not disprove them either.\\n71. Tracing the judicial view on Death Penalty, one can start with the Jagmohan Singh case (1973)\\nwhere it agreed with the Law Commission that capital punishment should be retained. But\\nsubsequent cases such as those of Ediga Anamma (1974) and Rajendra Prasad (1979) saw dissenting\\nvoices being raised in this court. These led to a hearing of the Bachan Singh (1980) case by a\\nConstitutional Bench.\\n72. In Rajendra Prasad v. State of U.P. [(1979) 3 SCR 646], it was held that the special reasons\\nnecessary for imposing a death penalty must relate not to the crime but to the criminal. It could be\\nawarded only if the security of the state and society, public order in the interest of the general public\\ncompelled that course.\\n73. The death penalty was abolished in 1965 in the U.K. Member-states of the European Union\\ncannot have the death penalty. In Canada, after the abolition of the death penalty in 1976, the\\nhomicide rate declined. In 2000, there were 542 homicides in Canada □ 16 fewer than in 1998 and\\n159 fewer than in 1975 (one year prior to the abolition of capital punishment). In 1997, the\\nAttorney-General of Massachusetts said: \"there is not a shred of credible evidence that the death\\npenalty lowers the murder rate. In fact, without the death penalty the murder rate in Massachusetts\\nis about half the national average.\"\\n74. The South African Constitutional Court unanimously ruled in 1995 that the death penalty for\\nmurder violated the country\\'s Constitution. More than 118 countries have abolished the death\\npenalty either in law or practice. The second optional protocol to the International Civil Covenant,\\nwhich came into force in 1991, mandates the abolition of the death penalty.\\n75. Whatever may be the \"merits\", \"demerits\" or \"criticism\", one cannot hope for unjustness in\\nsociety. Deterring or preventive theory may not have any application at all in respect of imposition\\nof death sentence. The law itself mandates that for imposing death sentence, special reasons are to\\nbe assigned. Imposition of death punishment is an exception in terms of sub- section (3) of Section\\n354 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

In Renuka Bai alias Rinku alias Ratan and Another v. State of Maharashtra [(2006) 7 SCC 442],\\nBalakrishnan, J.

Similarly in Bhimashya and Ors. v. Smt. Janabi @ Janawwa [2006 (14) SCALE 27], Dr. Pasayat,\\nJ. took into consideration the overall global view imparting death penalty.\\n78. This new trend, thus, must be taken into consideration only for awarding appropriate\\npunishment.\\n79. We may also note that in Ram Singh v. Sonia & Ors. [2007 (3) SCALE 106] imposition of a death\\npenalty has been upheld in the case where the accused had not only put an end to the life of her step\\nbrother and his whole family which included three tiny tots of 45 days, 2 □ = years and 4 years but\\nalso her own father, mother and sister in a very diabolic manner so as to deprive her father from\\ngiving the property to her step brother and his family. It was, in the aforementioned extraordinary\\nsituation, held:\\n\"□The fact that murders in question were committed in such a diabolic manner while\\nthe victims were sleeping, without any provocation whatsoever from the victims\\' side\\nindicates the cold-blooded and premeditated approach of the accused to cause death\\nof the victims.

Yet again, another Division Bench of this Court in Shivu (supra) has upheld the death penalty\\nwhere the accused was charged with Sections 302 and 376 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal\\nCode.

The court found that emboldened by the\\nescapes from punishment in those two incidents, the accused committed rape on the deceased a\\nyoung girl of hardly 18 years and to avoid detection committed heinous and brutal act of her\\nmurder.\\n81.

Though it is proved that there was an\\nunlawful assembly and the common object of that unlawful assembly was to kill the\\ndeceased persons, there is another aspect of the matter inasmuch as there is no clear\\nevidence by the use of whose fire-arm all the six deceased persons died as a result of\\nfiring in the bus. It is also pertinent to note that the investigating agency failed to\\nproduce clear and distinct evidence to prove the actual overt acts of each of the\\naccused. The failure to examine the driver and conductor of the bus, the failure to\\nseize the bus and the absence of a proper \\'mahzar\\', are all lapses on the part of\\ninvestigating agency. Moreover, the doctor who gave evidence before the court was\\nnot properly cross-examined regarding the nature of the injuries. Some more details\\ncould have been collected as to how the incident might have happened inside the bus.\\nThese facts are pointed out to show that the firing may have been caused by the\\nassailants even while they were still standing on the footboard of the bus and some of\\nthe appellants may not, in fact, have had an occasion to use the fire-arm, though they\\nfully shared the common object of the unlawful assembly. Imposition of the death\\npenalty on each of the five appellants may not be justified under such circumstances.\\nWe take this view in view of the peculiar circumstances of the case and it should not\\nbe understood to mean that the accused persons are not to be convicted under\\nSection 302 read with Section 149 and the death penalty cannot be imposed in the\\nabsence of various overt acts by individual accused persons. In view of the nature and\\ncircumstances of the case, we commute the death sentence imposed on A-1 Sahdeo,\\nA-4 Subhash, A-5 Chandraveer, A-7 Satyapal and A-10 Parvinder to imprisonment\\nfor life.\"\\n88. In Raju vs. State of Haryana [(2001) 9 SCC 50], it has been opined by this Court :\\n\"However, the next question is whether this would be a rarest of rare cases where\\nextreme punishment of death is required to be imposed. In the present case, from the\\nconfessional statement made by the accused, it would appear that there was no\\nintention on the part of the accused to commit the murder of the deceased child. He\\ncaused injury to the deceased by giving two brick blows as she stated that she would\\ndisclose the incident at her house. It is true that learned Sessions Judge committed\\nerror in recording the evidence of SI Shakuntala, PW 15 with regard to the\\nconfessional statement made to her, but in any set of circumstances, the evidence on\\nrecord discloses that the accused was not having an intention to commit the murder\\nof the girl who accompanied him. On the spur of the moment without there being any\\npremeditation, he gave two brick blows which caused her death. There is nothing on\\nrecord to indicate that the appellant was having any criminal record nor can he be\\nsaid to be a grave danger to the society at large. In these circumstances, it would be\\ndifficult to hold that the case of the appellant would be rarest of rare case justifyingSwamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 22'),\n",

It has been a fundamental point in numerous studies in the field of Death Penalty jurisprudence\\nthat cases where the sole basis of conviction is circumstantial evidence, have far greater chances of\\nturning out to be wrongful convictions, later on, in comparison to ones which are based on fitter\\nsources of proof. Convictions based on seemingly conclusive circumstantial evidence should not be\\npresumed as full proof incidences and the fact that the same are circumstantial evidence based must\\nbe a definite factor at the sentencing stage deliberations, considering that capital punishment is\\nunique in its total irrevocability. Any characteristic of trial, such as conviction solely resting on\\ncircumstantial evidence, which contributes to the uncertainty in the culpability calculus, must\\nattract negative attention while deciding maximum penalty for murder.\\n90. One of the older cases in this league dates back to 1874, Merritt v. State, 52 Ga. 82, 85 (1874)\\nwhere the Supreme Court of Georgia described the applicable law in Georgia as follows:\\n\"By the penal code of this state the punishment of murder shall be death, except\\nwhen the conviction is founded solely on circumstantial testimony. When the\\nconviction is had solely on circumstantial testimony, then it is discretionary with the\\npresiding judge to impose the death penalty or to sentence the defendant to\\nimprisonment in the penitentiary for life, unless the jury . . . shall recommend that\\nthe defendant be imprisoned in the penitentiary for life; in that case the presiding\\njudge has no discretion, but is bound to commute the punishment from death to\\nimprisonment for life in the penitentiary.\"\\n91. Later case of Jackson v. State, 74 Ala. 26, 29-30 (1883) followed the aforementioned case. [Also\\nsee S.M. Phillipps, Famous Cases of Circumstantial Evidence with an Introduction on the Theory of\\nPresumptive Proof 50-52 (1875)]\\n92. In United States v. Quinones, 205 F. Supp. 2d 256, 267 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) the court remarked:\\n\"Many states that allow the death penalty permit a conviction based solely on\\ncircumstantial evidence only if such evidence excludes to a moral certainty every\\nother reasonable inference except guilt.\"\\n93. In the instant case, confession before police was taken as a gospel truth. It seems that the\\njudicial mind has a role to play in that behalf in imposition of sentence.\\n94. Another aspect which needs to be considered as according to the Bachan Singh Rule (that\\nsentencing should involve analysis about the nature of crime as well as the accused) which require\\nconsideration, is the effect of two pointers relating to the nature of crime. Firstly, the case does not\\nseem to be an instance of what is called a diabolical murder. We come across cases of murdering\\nwife by burning for non-fulfillment of dowry, preceded by continuous torture. Simon and Ors. v.\\nState of Karnataka [(2004) 2 SCC 694] noting the \"all murders are cruel\" observation in Bachan\\nSingh (supra) puts the law on death penalty in perspective as:Swamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 23'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Swamy_Shraddananda_Murali_Manohar_vs_State_Of_Karnataka_on_18_May_2007.PDF', 'page': 23}, page_content='\"The Constitution Bench said that though all murders are cruel but cruelty may vary\\nin its degree of culpability and it is only then the culpability assumes the proportion\\nof extreme depravity that \"special reasons\" can legitimately be said to exist.\"\\n95. Second point relates to planning which went into committing the murder. It is agreed that\\naccused deliberately came close to the beautiful and wealthy lady. He must have had his intentions\\nand calculations in that regard. To that extent intention behind the marriage can be imputed. But to\\ninfer from that the murder was a pre-planned murder will be going a bit too far as he did not know\\nthe opportune date when the servant would be leaving the house. He could not have known the\\nservants would receive a telegram and ask for leave. Without their leaving the place, the plan, if\\nthere was any, could not have been executed. This is one weak link in the hypothesis that the murder\\nwas meticulously planned.\\n96. In Kashmir Singh v. State of Himachal Pradesh, [1990 Supp (1) SCC 133] the Court held:\\n\"There was no infirmity in appraisal of the facts and circumstances and the\\ncircumstantial evidence by the courts below in arriving at the conclusion that the\\naccused-appellant has committed the crime under Section 302 IPC. But considering\\nthe fact that it was not a pre-meditated and cold-blooded murder, and also because\\nthe appellant appeared before the Sessions Judge and made a confessional statement,\\nthe sentence is converted from death to life imprisonment.\"\\n97. Keeping the abovementioned other characteristics of the crime, we now delve into whether this\\ninstance can be categorized as a \"rarest of rare\"\\nmurder. The question is whether murder of wife for the purpose of usurping property\\nis a rarest of rare crime statistically. It is not to say that rarest of rare doctrine only\\nhas a statistical dimension i.e. incidence of particular type of murder in a given\\nsample; rarest of rare benchmark can also be used in the context of other parameters\\nsuch a brutality, planning, society\\'s reaction et al. Facets relating to nature of the\\ncrime have already been explained in terms of the few parameters mentioned just\\nnow. Therefore we attend to the incidence aspect. It can not be conclusively said that\\nmurder of wife for usurping property is a particularly rarest of rare incident. It could,\\nof course, be a rare incident.\\n98. Also it is to be realized that in criminal cases character of accused is immaterial by the mandate\\nof section 53 and 54 of Indian Evidence Act. The same should not factor in the discussions at the\\nsentencing stage. If that be so, bad character of the accused by itself should not be a determinative\\nfactor.\\n99. In fact, Appellant should not have been heard at that stage. The stage of hearing an accused\\nunder Section 235(2) of the Code is after the judgment of conviction is pronounced and not prior\\nthereto. Appellant herein made a confession before the High Court. The High Court took the same\\ninto consideration in the main judgment which could not be done. He had been brought before theSwamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 24'),\n",

His Statement was taken during midst of hearing. He knew the\\nimplications thereof. Despite the same, he made a categorical statement that he was responsible for\\nburring the dead body. He gave an explanation, which might not have found favour with the High\\nCourt, but the fact that he had made a confession at least accepting a part of the offence could not\\nhave been ignored at least for the purpose of imposition of punishment. He is more than 64 years'\\nold. He is in custody for a period of 16 years. The death sentence was awarded to him by the trial\\ncourt in terms of its judgment dated 20.05.2005. In a situation of this nature, we are of the opinion\\nthat imposition of a life imprisonment for commission of the crime under Section 302 shall serve\\nthe ends of justice.\\n100. However, while saying so, we direct that in a case of this nature 'life sentence' must be meant to\\nbe 'life sentence'. Such a direction can be given, as would appear from some precedents. {See\\nSubhash Chander v. Krishan Lal and Ors. [(2001) 4 SCC 458]}.\\n101. Yet again in Ram Anup Singh and Ors. v. State of Bihar [(2002) 6 SCC 686], this Court directed\\nthat the accused shall remain in jail for a period of not less than 20 years. [See Prakash Dhawal\\nKhairnar (Patil) v. State of Maharashtra, (2002) 2 SCC 35], Shri Bhagwan v. State of Rajasthan\\n[(2001) 6 SCC 296] and Mohd. Munna etc. v. Union of India & Ors. etc. [(2005) 7 SCC 417].\\n102. However, before parting with this case, we may notice that a prayer was made by Smt. Sabhah\\nKhaleeli (daughter of the deceased) that the mortal remains of Smt. Shakereh (deceased) including\\nskull are required by the family of the deceased for burial and obsequies ceremony. The High Court\\nhas issued such a direction. As the family of the deceased and in particular Smt. Sabah Khaleeli\\n(PW-5) desires to perform burial and other obsequies ceremonies, we direct that the order of the\\nHigh Court, in this behalf, may be implemented, as expeditiously as possible.\\n103. For the reasons aforementioned, the appeal is dismissed, subject to the modification in\\nsentence, as directed hereinbefore.Swamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 25\")]"

Delhi administration and another J U D G M E N T THOMAS,J.Sh. Satish Mehra vs Delhi Administration & Anr on 31 July, 1996\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1706613/ 1Some eerie accusations have been made by a wife against her husband. Incestous\\nsexual abuse, incredulous ex facie, is being attributed to the husband. Police on her\\ncomplaint conducted investigation and laid charge sheet against the appellant, who\\nhas filed this Criminal Appeal special leave as he did not succeed in his approach to\\nthe High court at the F.I.R. stage itself.\\nMore details of the case are these:\\nAppellant (Satish Mehra) and his wife (Anita Mehra) were living in New York ever\\nsince their marriage. They have three children among whom the eldest daughter\\n(Nikita) was born of 2nd April, 1988. Before and after the birth of the children\\nrelationship between husband and wife was far from cordial. Husband alleged that\\nhis wife, in conspiracy with her father, had siphoned off a whopping sum from his\\nbank deposits in India by forging his signature. He also alleged that his wife is\\nsuffering from some peculiar psychiatric condition. He approached a court at New\\nYork for securing custody of his children. On 31.10.1992 his wife left his house with\\nthe children and then filed a complaint with Saffolk County Police Station (United\\nStates) alleging that her husband had sexually abused Nikita who was then aged four.\\nUnited States police at the local level moved into action. But after conducting detailed\\ninvestigation concluded that the allegations of incestuous abuse are untrue.\\nOn 7.3.1993, appellant\\'s wife (Anita) returned to India with her children. In the\\nmeanwhile Family Court at New York has ordered that custody of the children be\\ngiven to the husband and a warrant of arrest was issued against Anita for\\nimplementation of the said order.\\nThe battle field between the parties was thereafter shifted to India as she came back\\nhome. On 19.3.1993, Anita filed a complaint to the \"Crime Against Women Cell\"\\n(CAW Cell for short) New Delhi in which she stated that her husband committed sex\\nabuses with Nikita while they were in United States and further alleged that appellant\\ncommitted certain matrimonial misdemeanour on his wife. But the complain was\\nclose but want of jurisdiction for the CAW Cell to investigate into what happened in\\nUnited States. Appellant returned to India on 127.1993 and thereafter filed a petition\\nfor a writ of Habeas Corpus for securing the custody of the children.\\nThe present case is based on a complaint filed by Anita before Greater Kailash Police\\nstation on 14.8.1993. FIR was prepared and a case was registered as Crime No.\\n197/93 for offences under Sections 354 and 498-A of Indian Penal Code. On\\n25.8.1993, the investigating officer moved the Sessions Court for adding Section 376\\nof the IPC also. The case was charge sheeted by the police and it was committed to\\nthe Court of Sessions.\\nAs committal proceedings took place during the pendency of the Special Leave\\nPetition, this Court directed the Sections judge on 22.2.1996 \"to apply its mind to theSh. Satish Mehra vs Delhi Administration & Anr on 31 July, 1996\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1706613/ 2case committed and see whether a case for framing charge/charges has been made\\nout or no\". Learned Session judge, by a detailed order, found that no charge under\\nSection 498-A IPC could be framed against the appellant, but charge for offences\\nunder Sections 354 and 376 read with Section 511 of IPC should be framed against\\nhim. Accordingly, the charge has been framed with the said two counts.\\nFirst count in the charge is that appellant had outraged the modesty of his minor\\ndaughter aged about 3 years during some time between March and July, 1991 at D-\\n108, East of Kailash, New Delhi by fondling with her vagina and also by inserting\\nbottle into it and thereby committed the offence under Section 354 of the IPC. Second\\ncount in the charge is that he made an attempt to commit rape on the said infant\\nchild (time and place are the same) and thereby committed the offence under Section\\n376 read with Section 511 of the IPC.\\nAt this stage it is superfluous to consider whether the FIR is liable to be quashed as both sides\\nargued on the sustainability of the charge framed by the Sessions Judge. We are, therefore,\\nconsidering the main question whether the Sessions Court should have framed the charge against\\nthe appellant as it did now.\\nConsiderations which should weigh with the Sessions Court at this state have been well designed by\\nthe Parliament through Section 227 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short \\'the Code\\') which\\nreads thus:\\n\"227. Discharge. - If, upon consideration of the record of the case and the documents\\nsubmitted therewith, and after hearing the submissions of the accused and the\\nprosecution there is not sufficient ground for proceeding accused and record his\\nreasons for so doing.\"\\nSection 228 contemplates the stage after the case survives the stage envisaged in the former section.\\nWhen the Court is of opinion that there is ground to presume that the accused has committed and\\noffence the procedure laid down therein has to be adopted. When those two section are put\\njuxtaposition with each other the test to be adopted becomes discernible: Is there sufficient ground\\nfor proceeding against the accused? It is axiomatic that the standard of proof normally adhered to at\\nthe final stage is not to be applied at the stage where the scope of consideration is where there is\\n\"sufficient ground for proceeding\". (Vide State of Bihar v. Ramesh Singh, AIR 1977 SO 2018, and\\nSupdt, & Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, West Bengal v. Anil Kumar Bhunja, 1979 Cr. L.J. 1390:\\nAIR 1980 SC 52).\\nIn Alamohan Das v. State of West Bengal (AIR 1970 SC\\n863) Shah, j. (as he then was) has observed in the context of considering the scope of committal\\nproceedings under Section 209 of the old Code of Criminal Procedure (1898) that a Judge can sift\\nand weight the materials on record by seeing whether there is sufficient evidence for commitment. It\\nis open to the Court to weight the total effect of the evidence and the documents produced to checkSh. Satish Mehra vs Delhi Administration & Anr on 31 July, 1996\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1706613/ 3whether there is any basic infirmity. Of course the exercise is to find out whether a prima facie case\\nagainst the accused has been made out.\\nIn Union of India v. Profullakumar- 1979 Cr.L.J. 154, this Court has observed that the Judge while\\nconsidering the question of framing the charge has \"the undoubted power to sift and wight the\\nevidence for the limited purpose of finding out whether a prima facie case against the accused has\\nbeen made out\". However, there Lordships pointed out that the test to determine a prima facie case\\nwould naturally dependent upon the facts of each case and it is difficult to lay down a rule of\\nuniversal application. \"By and large, however, if who view are equally possible and the Judge is\\nsatisfied that the evidence produced before him gives rise to some suspicion but not grave\\nsuspension, the Judge would be fully within his right to discharge the accused\". At the same time the\\nCourt cautioned that a roving enquiry into the pros and cons of the case by weighing the evidence as\\nif he was conducting the trial is not expected or even warranted at this stage.\\nAn incidental question which emerges in this context is whether the Session Judge can look into any\\nmaterial other than those produced by the prosecution. Section 226 of the Code obliges the\\nprosecution to describe the charge brought against the accused and to state by what evidence the\\nguilt of the accused would be proved. The Next provisions enjoins on the Session Judge to decide\\nwhether there is sufficient ground to proceed against the accused. In so deciding the Judge has to\\nconsider (1) the record of the case and (2) the documents produced therewith. He has then to hear\\nthe submissions of the accused as well as the prosecution on the limited question whether there is\\nsufficient ground to proceed. What is the scope of hearing the submissions? Should it be confined to\\nhearing oral arguments alone?\\nSimilar situation arise under Section 239 of the Code (which deals with trial of warrant cases on\\npolice report). In that situation the Magistrate has to afford the prosecution and the accused an\\nopportunity of being heard besides considering the police report and the documents sent therewith.\\nAt these two State the Code enjoins on the Court to give audience to the accused for deciding\\nwhether it is necessary to proceed to the next State. It is a matter of exercise of judicial mind. There\\nis nothing in the code which shrinks the scope of such audience to oral arguments. If the accused\\nsucceeds in producing any reliable material at that stage which might fatally affect even the very\\nsustainability of the case, it is unjust to suggest that no such material shall be looked into by the\\nCourt at that stage. Here the \"ground\" may be any valid ground including insufficiency of evidence\\nto prove charge.\\nThe object of providing such an opportunity as is envisaged in Section 227 of the code is to enable\\nthe Court to decide whether it is necessary to proceed to conduct the trial. If the case ends there it\\ngains a lot of time of the Court and saves much human efforts and cost. If the materials produced by\\nthe accused even at that early stage would clinch the issue, why should the Court shut it out saying\\nthat such documents need be produced only after wasting a lot more time in the name of trial\\nproceedings. Hence, we are of the view that Sessions Judge would be within his powers to consider\\neven material which the accused may produce at the stage contemplated in Section 227 of the Code.Sh. Satish Mehra vs Delhi Administration & Anr on 31 July, 1996\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1706613/ 4But when the Judge is fairly certain that there is no prospect of the case ending in conviction the\\nvaluable time of the Court should not be wasted for holding a trial only for the purpose of formally\\ncompleting the procedure to pronounce the conclusion on a future date. We are under heavy\\npressure of work-load. If the Sessions Judge is almost certain that the trial would only be an exercise\\nin futility or a sheer waste of time it is advisable to truncate or ship the proceedings at the stage of\\nSection 227 of the Code itself.\\nIn the present case learned Session Judge has missed certain germane aspects. Apart form the\\nseemingly incredulous nature of the accusations against a father that he molested his infant child\\n(who would have just passed her suckling stage the) the Sessions Judge out not to have overlooked\\nthe following telling circumstances.\\nThe complaint made by her with the New York police that her husband committed sexual offences\\nagainst her 18 months old female child was investigated by the New York police and found the\\ncomplaint bereft of truth hook, line and sinker. The present charge is that the appellant committed\\nsuch offences against the same child at East Kailash, New Delhi some time during March to July,\\n1991. There is now no case of what happened in United States. There is now no case of what\\nhappened in United States. The Sessions Judge should have noted that appellant\\'s wife has not even\\nremotely alleged in the complaint filed by her on 19.3.1993 before CAW Cell , New Delhi that\\nappellant has done anything like that while he was in India. Even the other complaint. petition (on\\nwhich basis the FIR was prepared) is totally silent about a case that appellant did anything against\\nhis daughter anywhere in India. when we perused the statement of Anita Mehra (second\\nrespondent) we felt no doubt that the has been brimming with acerbity towards the petitioner on\\naccount of other causes. She describes her marital life with petitioner as \\'extremely painful and\\nunhappy from the very inception\". She complains that petitioner has \"a history of irrational\\noutbursts of temper and violence\". She accused him of being alcoholic and prone to inflicting server\\nphysical violence on her form 1980 onwards.\\nThus her attitude to the petitioner, even de hors the allegation involving the child, was vengeful. We\\ntake into account the assertion of the of the petitioner that the present story involving Nikita was\\nconcocted by the second respondent to wreak her vengeance by embroiling him in serious criminal\\ncases in India so that the could be nailed down here and prevent him from going back to U.S.A.\\nWhile hearing the arguments we ascertained whether the spouses could settle their differences.\\nSecond respondent, who to was present in court, made an offer through her counsel that she could\\nagree for annulling the criminal proceedings against the petitioner on the condition that he should\\nwithdraw his claims on the bank deposits and would also relinquish his claim for custody of the\\nchildren, and further he should concede for a divorce. In response to the said conditional offer,\\npetitioner agreed to give up all his claims on the large amounts in bank deposits, and further agreed\\nto have the divorce. But he stood firm that on no account custody of the children could go to the\\nsecond respondent but if made to, subject to his rights of visitation. This, he said, is because he is\\nconvinced that second respondent is unsuitable to be entrusted with the care of the children.\\nIn the above context petitioner drew our special notice to a medical report issued by Dr. Prabha\\nKapoor (Children Medical Centre, Jorbagh, New Delhi) On 26.7.1992. It is stated in report, thatSh. Satish Mehra vs Delhi Administration & Anr on 31 July, 1996\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1706613/ 5Nikita was brought to the doctor by the second respondent and on examination of the genetals of the\\nchild the doctor noticed \" a wide vaginal opening -wider than would be expected of her age group.\"\\nOn the strength of the aforesaid medical report, petitioner made a frontal attack on second\\nrespondent, alleging that in order concoct medical evidence against him the little child\\'s genitals\\nwould have been badly manipulated by its mother. To substantiate this allegation he drew our\\nattention to the U.S. police report, in which there is mention of a medical examination conducted on\\nNikita by a U.S. doctor (Dr. Gordon) on 24.11.92. That doctor pointed out that there was absolutely\\nno indication of any sexual abuse when the child was physically examined. If the medical\\nexamination done on the child in November, 1992 showed such normal condition, petitioner posed\\nthe question -who would have meddled with the child\\'s genitals before 26.7.93, to case such a\\nwidening of the vaginal office? (We now remember again that, as per present case, the last occasion\\nwhen the petitioner should have abused the child was in July, 1991). The aforesaid question, posed\\nby the petitioner in the context of expressing grave concern over what the mother might do with the\\nlittle female child for creating evidence of sex abuse, cannot be sideline by us in considering whether\\nthe case should proceed to the trial stage.\\nPetitioner invited out attention to the answers which Mrs. Veena Sharma (of CAWC) has elicited\\nfrom Nikita, a verbatim reproduction of which is given in the counter affidavit filed by the second\\nrespondent. The said interrogation record reveals that Mrs. Veena Sharma has practically put on the\\ntongue of the little girl that her father had molested her. The following questions and answers can\\nbring the point home the questions. The questioner asked the child \"what your dady did with you\"\\nand the child answered that he put his finger (and showed her private part). Not being satisfied with\\nthe answer the next question put to the child was \"Dady puts what else\". Then Nikita answers \"Dady\\nputs his bottle\". We noticed with disquiet that the questioner drew the picture of the petitioner -face\\nbody and then asked certain questions such as \"where is papa\\'s bottle? Is it on the cupboard?\" The\\nchild kept looking at the drawn sketch and pointed to the part between legs. Questioner then asked\\nif anything was missing in the picture, to which Nikita Answered \"glesses\". After the child again\\npointed to the private parts between the legs, the questioner wanted the child to draw \"papa\\'s\\nbottle\". But then the child told her \"you do it.\" The questioner at the stage had the temerity to draw\\nthe picture of the private parts of child\\'s father. We are much disturbed at the manner in which the\\nlittle child was interrogated by the said officer of CAW Cell. At any rate we have no doubt that the\\npurpose of such questions was to lead the child unmistakably to the tutored answers.\\nEven overlooking all the inherent infirmities shrouding the testimony of a tiny tot speaking about\\nwhat her further did when she was aged 3 and even ignoring the appellant\\'s persistent submission\\nthat the little child was briskly tutored by her mother to speak to the present version, There is no\\nreasonable prospect of the sessions court relaying on such a testimony to reach the conclusion that\\nthe prosecution succeeded in proving the offence charged beyond all reasonable doubt.\\nOver and above that, what would be the consequence if this nebulous allegation is allowed to\\nproceed to the trial stage. We foresee that Nikita, the child witness, now eight years and four month\\nold, mus necessarily be subjected to cross-questions involving sex and sex organs. The traumatic\\nimpact on the child when she would be confronted by volley of questions dealing with such a subject\\nis a matter of concerned to us. We cannot brush aside the submission of the appellant that such anSh. Satish Mehra vs Delhi Administration & Anr on 31 July, 1996\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1706613/ 6ordeal would inflict the appellant that such an ordeal would inflict devastating impairment on the\\ndevelopment of child\\'s personality. Of course, if such a course is of any use to the cause of justice, we\\nmay have to bear with it as an inevitable course of action to be resorted to. But in this case, when the\\ntrial is going to be nothing but a farce, such a course of action should not be allowed to take place on\\naccount of the impeding consequences befalling an innocent child.\\nAfter adverting to the above aspects and bestowing our anxious consideration we unhesitatingly\\nreach the conclusion that there is no sufficient ground to proceed to the trial in this case.\\nWe, therefore, quash the proceedings and the charge framed by the Sessions Judgement and\\ndischarge the appellant. The appeal would stand allowed.Sh.

The respondent, Duncans Agro Industries\\nLtd., moved the Calcutta High Court for quashing the said FIRs lodged by the Central\\nBureau of Investigation.\\nIt was inter alia alleged in the FIR dated August 14, 1987 that reliable information\\nwas received by the complainant, the Superintendent of Police, CBI, SIU(x), New\\nDelhi, that M/S National Tobacco Company which was a division of M/s Duncans\\nAgro Industries Ltd, had cash credit facilities on hypothacation of stocks etc, with\\nUnited Bank of India, Royal Exchange Branch, Calcutta. The ultimate credit facilities\\nlimit sanctioned to m/s Duncans Agro Industries Ltd., in the account of M/s National\\nTobacco Company as on January 12, 1984 was to the tune of Rs. 17.50 crores subject\\nto the drawing power according to hypothecation of raw materials/stocks etc. M/s\\nDuncans Agro Industries Ltd, was submitting the monthly statements of raw\\nmaterials held by its division, M/s National Tobacco Company and such\\nhypothecated raw materials were liable to Physical inspection and verification by\\nBank authorities. In 1984, M/s Duncans Agro Industries Ltd, mode an application\\nbefore the Calcutta High Court and obtained an order from the High Court on August\\n10,1984 that National Tobacco Company, a Tobacco Division of Duncans Agro\\nIndustries Ltd, would henceforth function under the name and style of new Tobacco\\nCompany Limited which would be fully downed subsidiary of M/s Duncans Agro\\nIndustries Ltd and the management of the said newly constituted company would be\\ncarried as per the Scheme of Arrangement approved by the High Court.

It was further\\nalleged in the FIR that the Board of Directors of United Bank of India were misled\\nbecause of the omissions and commissions of the officials of the Bank and the said\\nBoard of Directors acted on legal opinion of Shri Ghosh although such opinion was\\ndetrimental to the interest of the Bank. In the FIR, it was also alleged that credit\\nlimits were got transferred to the New Tobacco Company and M/S DUNCANS Agro\\nIndustries Limited had managed with the executive and Directors of the Bank to\\ntransfer the debts of the said Duncans Agro Industries Limited to Nil without any\\npayment.

It was also alleged in the FIR that in order to defraud the Bank\\nand to nullify the assurance given to the Bank, M/s Duncans Agro Industries Limited\\nentered into a memorandum of understanding with M/s New Tobacco Company on\\nMarch 6, 1986 in order to render the very basis of the scheme approved by the High\\nCourt infructuous and to complete the delinking of Duncans Agro Industries Limited\\nand New Tobacco Company so that the assets of Duncans Agro Industries Limited\\nwould remain out of reach of its creditors. By such process, the United Bank of India\\nwas defrauded. It was alleged in the FIR that the stock worth about Rs.12 crores were\\neither fraudulantly of dishonestly removed or disposed of without any payment to the\\nBank although the same were hypothecated with the Bank. In the FIR, it was alleged\\nthat Shri G.P.

Mukherjee and others.\\nMr Tulsi, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the appellants, has submitted that both\\nthe FIRs contain allegations of facts which constitute essential ingredients of the offence referred to\\nin the respective FIR. Mr. Tulsi has submitted that the essential ingredients for the offence of\\ncriminal breach of trust defined in Section 405 and punishable under Sections 406 and 409 IPC are:\\na) Entrustment of property in any manner or creation of dominion over property; b)\\nDishonest misappropriation, conversion to his own use of disposal of the said\\nproperty; (c) Misappropriation etc. In violation of any legal contract touching the\\ndischarge of such trust; d) Misappropriation either by the Person entrusted with\\nproperty or through any other person.\\nHe has submitted that allegations in FIR No. RC-4/1987 satisfy each of the essential ingredients of\\nthe offences under Suction 403. It has been submitted by Mr. Tulsi that the ultimate credit facility\\nlimit sanctioned to M/s Duncans Agro Industries Limited (hereinafter referred to as DAIL) in the\\naccount of National Tobacco Company as on January 12, 1984 was to the tune of Rs.17.50 crores\\nsubject to drawing power. In view of hypothecation of raw materials stocks etc., DAIL was\\nsubmitting the monthly statement of raw materials held by its division. National Tobacco Company\\nand the same was liable to physical inspection and verification by Bank officials. Such facts clearly\\nconstitute entrustment as envisaged under Section 405 IPC. The allegations in the FIR about the\\nrequest made by DAIL to the United Bank of India for transfer of credit facilities in their name to\\nM/s New Tobacco Company on December 3, 1984 and as a result of conspiracy a wrong opinion was\\ngiven by the Chief Officer (Legal) and the Board of Directors of the Bank was misled so that the\\ntransfer limit in favour of New Tobacco Company was allowed by the Board without inspection and\\nverification of the stocks and by deliberately withholding of relevant material from the Board by the\\nofficials of the Bank and the allegations that later on, a memorandum of understanding was entered\\nbetween DAIL and New Tobacco Company by which the shareholding of DAIL as per the scheme of\\narrangement approved by the High Court was altered, clearly constitute an offence of\\nmisappropriation of the property entrusted to the Bank. Mr, Tulsi has also submitted that theCentral Bureau Of Investigation, ... vs Duncans Agro Industries Ltd.,Calcutta on 9 July, 1996\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/980208/ 5allegations that stock worth about Rs. 12 crores were fraudulently or dishonestly removed or\\ndisposed of without any payment to the Bank with whom the same were hypothecated with the\\nconnivance of the concerned Bank official prima facie make out the offence of misappropriation of\\nthe entrusted property in clear breach of trust. Mr. Tulsi has also submitted that essential\\ningredients of the offence of forgery Punishable under Section 468 and 471 IPC as contained in\\nSection 464 IPC have also been made out in the FIR . Mr. Tulsi has submitted that the essential\\ningredients for creating false document as contained in Section 464 are:\\na) Dishonest or fradulently making of the document; b) Intention to create a belief that it was made\\nby or by the authority of a person; c) Knowledge that it was not made with the authority of that\\nperson.\\nMr. Tulsi has also submitted that the allegations to the following effect that: \"Shri D.K. Sengupta\\nsigned the memorandum as Chief Manager, which post was not being occupied by him not he had\\nany authority to sign as such. Shri S.K. Hajra, Law Officer has willfully and unauthorisedly filled up\\nthe body portion of the said memorandum of satisfaction.\" - Prims facie make out an offence under\\nSection 468 and 471 IPC.\\nMr. Tulsi has also submitted that the essential ingredients of the offence of cheating as contained in\\nSection 415 IPC are:-\\na) Dishonest inducement; b) Delivery of any property as a result of inducement; c) Damage or harm\\nto the person induced.\\nMr. Tulsi has submitted that each of such ingredients of the said offence is satisfied on the face of\\nthe allegations made in the FIR. There is specific allegation that the representation was made by the\\nofficers of the Bank with regard to the existence of stock worth Rs. 17.50 crores for hypothecation to\\nthe Bank and credit facility was granted to the tune of Rs. 17.50 crores on the belief of due\\nhypothecation of stock. There is also allegation in FIR that stock worth Rs.12 crores had been\\nfraudulently or dishonestly used or disposed of without any payment to the Bank. Such allegations\\nconstitute ingredients of cheating, causing damage to the Bank which was induced because of false\\nstatement made by DAIL and its officials. Mr. Tulsi has submitted that entrustment of physical\\npossession of the property is not essential for the offence defined in Section 405 IPC. The expression\\n\"whoever being in any manner entrusted with property or with any dominion over property\", clearly\\nnegatives the contention that since physical possession was not exclusively transferred to the Bank,\\nthere can not be a case of entrustment. If the offence under Section 405 IPC is interpreted in the\\naforesaid manner, it will open the flood gate for Bank frauds, corruption amongst public servants\\nand will endanger the smooth flow of trade and commerce. In support of this contention, Mr. Tulsi\\nhas relied in the decision of this court in The Superintendent and Remembrance of Legal Affairs,\\nWest Bengal Vs. S.K.Roy (1971 (4) SCC 230) It has been held in the said decision that:\\nThere are, however, two distinct parts involved in the commission of the offence of\\ncriminal breach of trust. The first consists of the creation of an obligation in relation\\nto the property over which dominion or control is acquired by the accused. TheCentral Bureau Of Investigation, ... vs Duncans Agro Industries Ltd.,Calcutta on 9 July, 1996\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/980208/ 6second is a misappropriation or dealing with the property dishonestly and contrary to\\nthe terms of the obligation created.\\nIn the case of an offence by a public servant punishable under Section 409, I.P.C. the\\nacquisition of dominion or control over the property must also be in the capacity of a\\npublic servant. This is not the same thing as having the authority, as a public servant\\nto get the control or dominion over property annexed with an obligation. The\\ngravamen of the offence is the dishonest misappropriation of the money or property\\nwhich comes into the possession or under the control of a public servant who has the\\nostensible authority to receive it even though, technically speaking, form the point of\\nview of view of the distribution of departmental duties under internal rules of an\\noffence, it may not be within the scope of his authority or duty to accept the money.\\nThe fact that a public servant acts fraudulently in the exercise of his duties as a public\\nservant to get dominion or control over some property will be an aggravating and not\\nan exculpating circumstance. The \"entrustment\" results from what the person\\nhanding over money or property to a public servant, servant, and believe about the\\npurpose for which he which he hands over money or property is made to think,\\nunderstand and believe about the purpose for which he hands over money or\\nproperty to a public servant. It this place because of and due to the exercise of the\\nofficial authority the requirements of Section 409, IPC, are satisfied.\\nOrdinarily, it is the ostensible or apparent scope of a public servant\\'s authority when\\nreceiving property and not its technical limitations, under some internal rules of the\\ndepartment or office concerned, and the use made by the servant of his actual official\\ncapacity which determine whether there is a sufficient nexus or connection between\\nthe acts complained of and the official capacity so to bring it within the ambit of\\nSection 409 IPC.\\nTo constitute an offence under Section 409, IPC it is not required that\\nmis-appropriation must necessarily take place after the creation of a legally correct\\nentrustment of dominion over property. The entrustment may arise in \"any manner\\nwhatsoever\", That manner whatsoever\", That manner may or may not involve\\nfraudulent conduct of the accused. Section 409, IPC covers dishonest\\nmisappropriation in both types of cases; that is itself fraudulent or improper and\\nthose where the public servant misappropriation what may have been quite properly\\nand innocently received. All that is required is what may by described as\\n\"entrustment\" or acquisition of dominion over property in the capacity of a public\\nservant servant who, as a result of it, becomes charged with a duty to act in a\\nparticular way, or, at least honestly.\\nThe obligation to act in a certain manner with regard to or to deal honestly with\\nproperty, over which a public servant obtains dominion or control the use of his\\nofficial capacity may arise either expressly or impliedly.Central Bureau Of Investigation, ... vs Duncans Agro Industries Ltd.,Calcutta on 9 July, 1996\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/980208/ 7Mr. Tulsi has also submitted that the investigations had not been completed in\\nrespect of the allegations made in the FIR. At that stage, the High Court must accept\\neach of the allegations made in the FIR as correct on its face value for the purpose of\\ndetermining as to whether the ingredients of the offences alleged in the FIR are\\ncontained therein or not. Mr.Tulsi has submitted that the High Court has grossly\\nerred in quashing the complaints. Mr. Tulsi has also submitted that the High Court is\\nnot justified in quashing the FIRs so as to strangulate the investigations at the\\ninception. What value to be attached to the allegations made in the FIR is to be\\nexamined at trial when on the basis of FIR charge sheet will be framed. It is not the\\nduty of the High Court to embark upon appreciation of evidence in quashing the\\nproceedings. In support of this contention, Mr. Tulsi has relied in the decisions of this\\nCourt in State of Haryana Vs. Bhajan Lal (1992) (1) SCC 335), State of Bihar Vs. P.P.\\nSharma (1992 (Supp.) (1) SCC 222), Janata Dal Vs. H.S Choudhary (1992 (4) SCC\\n305).\\nMr. Tulsi has also submitted that it is not alleged that the FIRs were made with an\\noblique or mala fide purpose. Hence, the same are not liable to be quashed even\\nbefore completing the investigations.\\nMr. Tulsi has also submitted that a particular act may constitute booth civil wrong as\\nwell as criminal wrong but merely because civil action is also pursued, such course of\\naction does not render criminal action impermissible. It has been contended by Mr.\\nTulsi that since the very definition of offence of criminal breach of trust is founded on\\nlegal contract touching upon the discharge of trust, almost every case of criminal\\nbreach of trust is bound to have an element of civil liability. Policy of the legislature\\nin enacting the offence under Section 405 IPC, therefore, is to treat the breach of\\ncontract in the matter of property which is entrusted as an aggravated civil wrong and\\nthereby constituting a criminal offence. That being the policy, to quash a FIR on the\\nground that a civil remedy has already been invoked would be destructive of the\\nobject of the legislation. In this connection, Mr. Tulsi has relied on the decision of\\nthis Court in Collector of Customs and Central Excise, Bhubneshwar, District Puri Vs.\\nParadip Port Trust and Another (1990 (4) SCC 205). It has been held in the said\\ndecision that:-\\nWhere the same act or event constitutes an offence under Chapter XVI and at the\\nsame time constitutes a contravention or abetment of contravention of any of the\\nprovisions of the Customs Act or failure to perform any duty prescribed under the Act\\nor amounts to non-compliance with any of the provisions of the Act, there will be\\npossibility of prosecutions and punishment under Chapter XVI of the Act and any\\nother provision of law and at the same time confiscation and penalty under Chapter\\nXVI of the Act.\\nMr. Tulsi has also submitted that in cases were civil and criminal remedies are sought\\nto be pursued, the criminal case has to be given preference over civil cases. In supportCentral Bureau Of Investigation, ... vs Duncans Agro Industries Ltd.,Calcutta on 9 July, 1996\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/980208/ 8of this submission, Mr. Tulsi has referred to a decision of this Court in M. S. Sheriff\\nVs. The State of Madras and Others (1954 SCR 1144). It has been held in the said\\ndecision that :\\nSimultaneous prosecution of civil and criminal proceedings regarding the same\\nmatter is likely to embarrass the accused and so ordinarily, and in the absence of\\nspecial circumstances, the criminal proceedings should be given precedence and the\\ncivil proceedings should be stayed pending the termination of the criminal.\\nMr. Tulsi has also submitted that in a case of grove misappropriation of huge\\namounts of public funds, delay caused by the accused was not a valid ground for\\nquashing the criminal proceedings. In this connection, Mr. Tulsi has relied on the\\ndecision of this Court in Union of India Vs. B. R. Bajaj (1994 (2) SCC 277). In the said\\ncase, the FIR of 1984 was quashed by the Court in 1986 but nine years, the decision of\\nthe High Court was set aside and it was directed that the investigation should\\nrecommence. Mr. Tulsi has submitted that FIRs disclose the offences of cheating the\\nnationalised Banks of huge sum of money by the accused in calculated manner. In\\nsuch circumstances, it will be only proper that the CBI should be permitted to\\ncontinue with further investigations and on the face of the allegations in the FIRs\\nwhich clearly constitute offences against the accused, there was no reason to quash\\nthe FIRs and thereby stopping the investigation at the threshold. He has, therefore,\\nsubmitted that the appeal should be allowed and the CBI should be permitted to\\nproceed with the investigation for the purpose of framing the chargesheet.\\nMr. Shanti Bhushan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondents, has\\ndisputed the contentions made by Mr. Tulsi. He has submitted that the two FIRs did\\nnot made out any offence of criminal breach of trust, forgery or cheating and,\\ntherefore, the High Court was justified in quashing the said FIRs. Referring to the\\nallegations made in the FIR No. RC-4/87 dated September 14, 1987 that inspite of the\\nScheme of Arrangement approved by the High Court of Calcutta separating the\\nTobacco Division of DAIL into a new company i.e. new Tobacco Company Limited\\nM/s DAIL would remain liable for all assets and liabilities of the newly formed\\nsubsidiary Company, Mr. Shanti Bhushan has submitted that pursuant to the Scheme\\nof Arrangement duly sanctioned by the Calcutta High Court on or about July 31,\\n1984, the Tobacco Division of DAIL was transferred to and vested along with all its\\nassets and liabilities in New Tobacco Company Limited with effect from April 1, 1984.\\nDAIL was the transferor Company and New Tobacco Company Limited was the\\ntransferor Company. The order of the High Court was to the effect that all the assets\\nand liabilities and duties of the said transferor Company relating the its Tobacco\\nDivision be transferred from the said date without further act or deed to the said\\ntransferee Company. Accordingly and also pursuant to Section 394 (2) of the\\nCompanies Act, 1965 all the assets and liabilities of the Tobacco Division stood\\ntransferred to the New Tobacco Company Limited and such assets and liabilities\\nbecame assets and liabilities of the said transferee Company. The liability of DAIL toCentral Bureau Of Investigation, ... vs Duncans Agro Industries Ltd.,Calcutta on 9 July, 1996\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/980208/ 9the United Bank of India as on APRIL 1, 1984 stood transferred to New Tobacco\\nCompany Limited. The order of the High Court clearly provided that no further act or\\ndeed was necessary to give effect to the Scheme of Arrangement. In view of such\\nScheme of Arrangement, the Board of Directors of the United Bank of India approved\\nthe transfer of credit facilities from M/s DAIL to the New Tobacco Company Limited.\\nThere was no question of the Board being misinformed of the material facts in the\\nmatter. Further in June/July 1985 fresh hypothecation documents were executed by\\nthe New Tobacco Company Limited and a memorandum of satisfaction of charge was\\nfiled by the Bank in respect of DAIL to the Registrar of Companies. The necessary\\ndocuments were also filed by the Bank with the Registrar evidencing the charge\\ncreated in favour of New Tobacco Company Limited.\\nMr. Shanti Bhushan has also submitted that the allegation in the FIR that the opinion\\nof Shri S.K.Ghosh, Chief Officer (Legal) of the United Bank of India to the effect that\\nthe bank would not be in a position to enforce its right in respect of the transferor\\nCompany was erroneous and designedly made, is also incorrect and without any\\nbasis. Mr. Shanti Bhushan has submitted that as a matter of fact, the said opinion of\\nShri S.K.Ghosh in accordance with the Scheme of Arrangement since all the assets\\nand liabilities of the Tobacco Division of DAIL stood transferred to New Tobacco\\nCompany form April 1, 1984, Mr. Shanti Bhushan has further submitted that even if\\nit is assumed that such legal opinion was not correct, no ill motive can be assigned to\\nthe said Officer because the opinion itself was placed for consideration by the highest\\nadministrative body of the Bank, namely, the Board of Directors. Mr. Shanti Bhushan\\nhas also referred to the allegation in the FIR that;\\n\"On March 6, 1996 M/s New Tobacco Company Limited submitted a statement to\\nUnited Bank of India wherein the aggregate value of stocks etc. was to the tune of\\nRs.5.13 crores only as against Rs.16.55 crores on November 30, 1985. It is alleged that\\nthe stocks worth about Rs.12 crores were either fraudulently and dishonestly\\nremoved or disposed of without any payment to the bank with whom the same were\\nhypothecated, with the connivance of the concerned bank officials.\"\\nMr. Shanti Bhushan has submitted that it is not alleged that the statement of stocks\\nwas incorrect ether on March 6, 1985. In fact, two statements correctly pointed out\\nthat while the value of the stocks on November 30,1985 was Rs.16.58 crores, the\\nvalue of stocks on March 6, 1986 had gone down to Rs.5.13 crores. There was,\\ntherefore, no false statement in the declaration of stocks. Mr. Shanti Bhushan has\\nsubmitted that since the stocks were hypothecated and not pledge with the bank the\\npossession over the stocks was with the Company and not with the bank. The\\ndifference between a pledge and a hypothecation is that while in the case of pledge\\nthe stocks are give in the custody in the bank and are kept under their key and any\\nremoval of any part of those stocks by the debtor, without the consent of the Band\\nwould be an offence, it would not be so in the case of hypothecation. In a case of\\nhypothecation, there is only a floating charge on various assets. The possession overCentral Bureau Of Investigation, ... vs Duncans Agro Industries Ltd.,Calcutta on 9 July, 1996\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/980208/ 10those assets continues to be with the debtor and debtor was always entitled to remove\\nany part of those stocks and sell them from time to time. Mr. Shanti Bhushan has\\nsubmitted that if there is a contractual term that the value of the hypothecated stocks\\nshould not be allowed to go down below a particular amount, there may be a breach\\nof contract the Bank to take civil proceeding for damages against the debtor.\\nHowever, it has not been alleged that there has been breach of any such contract\\nparticularly when documents which are being relied upon by the Bank themselves\\nshow that the value of the hypothecated property continued to be much more than\\nthe amount of loan at any point of time, much more than the amount of loan at any\\npoint of time. If a reference is made to the said balance sheet, it would show that the\\nadvances under the cash credit facility granted by the United Bank of India ware\\nsecured not only the hypothecation of stocks but also by the hypothecation of book\\ndebts and plant and machinery of the Company\\'s Tobacco Division. Mr. Shanti\\nBhushan has submitted that while the loans due to the United Bank of India\\namounted to Rs.13,78,82,685.17, the value of the hypothecated property on the same\\ndate was nearly double of that amount. Reference to the balance sheet would show\\nthat the book debts comprised goods worth Rs. 15,34,82,521.12 and machinery as on\\nMarch 31, 1984 worth Rs.1,14,71,499 and the stocks and spares were of the value of\\nRs.12,39,27,002.19 as on March 31, 1984.\\nMr. Shanti Bhushan has further submitted that even in the case of the FIR relating to\\nthe Canara Bank, it is apparent that the balance sheet of Tobacco Division of DAIL as\\non March 31, 1984 which was filed by the CBI, showed that the value of the property\\nhypothecated to united Bank of India exceeded the amount of the loan as on that date\\nby mare than Rs.15 crores and thus some part of the stocks worth more than Rs.2\\ncrores were available for being hypothercated to Canara Bank. Mr. Shanti Bhushan\\nhas submitted that the CBI had misread the balance sheet and erroneously proceeded\\non the footing that it was only the stocks which were alone hypothecated to the\\nUnited Bank of India. Balance Sheet itself indicated that book debts of more than Rs.\\n15 crores and the machinery worth more than Rs. 2 crores were also hypothecated to\\nthe United Bank of India and thus stocks worth more than Rs.2 crores were clearly\\navailable for hypothecation to the Canara Bank.\\nMr. Shanti Bhushan has referred to the allegations in the FIR that:\\n\"The Ultimate credit facility limit sanctioned to M/s DAIL in the account of M/s New\\nTobacco Company as on 12.1.1984 was to the tune of Rs.17.50 crores subject to\\ndrawing power agreeing to hypothecation of raw materials, stocks etc, M/s DAIL was\\nsubmitting the statements of raw materials held by its division M/s New Tobacco\\nCompany and the same was liable for physical inspection and verification by Bank\\nofficials.\"\\nMr. Shanti Bhushan has submitted that the above allegations did not make out any\\noffence of criminal breach of trust. According to Mr. Shanti Bhushan, the essentialCentral Bureau Of Investigation, ... vs Duncans Agro Industries Ltd.,Calcutta on 9 July, 1996\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/980208/ 11ingredients of criminal breach of trust is entrustment of property or entrustment of\\ndominion over property. The grant of credit facility giving of a loan in pursuance of\\nthat credit facility cannot possibly amount to entrustment of property. A loan is quite\\ndifferent form entrustment of money. Similarly, when the debtor hypothecates his\\ngoods to Bank by way of security, there is no entrustment of those goods to the bank\\nby the debtor. Even if there is any contravention of the terms of the contract under\\nwhich credit facilities are given, it will be merely a breach of contract for which the\\nBank may made debtor liable for damages under the civil law. There will be no\\noccasion for committing any offence of criminal breach of trust. In support of this\\ncontention, Mr Shanti Bhushan has relied on the decision of this Court in Velji\\nRaghavji Patel Vs. State of Maharashtra (1965 (2) SCR 429). It has been held in the\\nsaid decision that in order to establish entrustment of dominion over property to an\\naccused person, the mere existence of that person\\'s dominion over property is not\\nenough. It must be further shown that his dominion was the result must be further\\nshown that his dominion was the result of entrustment.\\nMr. Shanti Bhushan has also referred to a decision of this Court in State of Gujarat\\nVs. Jaswantlal Natha lal (1968 (2) SCR 408). In the said decision it has been\\nindicated that the term \\' entrusted\\' found in Section 405 IPC Governs not only the\\nwords with the property immediately following it but also the words with the\\nproperty immediately following it but also the words or \\'with any dominion over the\\nproperty\\' occurring thereafter. Before there can be any entrustment, the entrustment\\ncarries with it the implication that the person handing over any property or on whose\\nbehalf that property is handed over to another, continues to be its owner. A mere\\ntransaction of sale cannot amount to an entrustment. It has been observed in the said\\ndecision that although the government had sold the cement in question to BSS solely\\nfor the purpose of being used in connection with the construction work referred to\\nearlier, that circumstance does not make the transaction in question anything other\\nthan a sale, After delivery of the cement, the government has neither any right not\\ndominion over it, It the purchaser had failed to comply with the requirements of any\\nlaw relating to cement control, he should have been prosecuted for the same, But the\\ncourt was unable to hold that there was any breach of trust.\\nComing to the question of offences under Sections 467, 468 and 471 IPC Mr. Shanti\\nBhushan has also submitted that no offence under the aforesaid Sections even prima\\nfacie, has been committed even on the face value of the Allegations in the FIR. Mr.\\nShanti Bhushan has submitted that it is the case of the CBI claims of both the Banks\\nhave been satisfied and the disputes have been compromised in the civil suits field by\\nthe Banks. Accordingly, it will no longer be a fit case for carrying out further\\ninvestigation in respect of the offences alleged.\\neferring to a recant decision of this Court in Feroze Dinshaw Lam Vs.

Shanti Bhushan has submitted that in that case although a clear offence of fabrication of\\nevidence had been establish against Godrej Company and its Directors and officials, the Supreme\\nCourt set aside the order of the High Court directing a complaint to be filed holding that in view of\\nall the circumstances including the payment of the Excise Duty, it would bot be expedient to\\nproceedagainst the accused persons, Mr. Shanti Bhushan has submitted that any further\\ninvestigation in the matter of offences alleged in the FIRs after such a long lapse of time and after\\nthe claims of the Banks have been satisfied in Civil Suits instituted by the Banks, is not at all\\nexpedient and on that score also no interference by this Court under the discretionary jurisdiction\\nunder Article 136 of the Constitution against the impugned decision of the High Court is not called\\nfor.\\nMr. Shanti Bhushan has also submitted that the first FIR was registered in 1987 and the second one\\nwas registered in 1989. The challenge to the Firs. were made in the Calcutta High Court only in 1991.\\nThe CBI therefore, had more than four years time to complete the investigations without any\\ninterruption. But admittedly the investigations have not yet been completed. Mr. Shanti Bhushan\\nhas submitted that FIRs have been filed in order to resort to are twisting tactics by the CBI and for\\nlaunching an fishing and roving enquiry without any reasonable basis. In any event, When the\\ninterest of the Banks have been safeguarded in the civil suits instituted by the Banks having ended in\\ncompromise, no useful propose will be served in proceeding with further investigation after such a\\nlong lapse of time.

For\\nquashing the complaint by way of action at the threshold. It is, therefore, necessary to consider\\nwhether no the face of the allegations, a criminal offence is constituted or not. In recent decisions of\\nthis Court, the case of Bhajan Lal (supra), since relied on by Mr. Tulsi, the guiding principles in\\nquashing a criminal case have been indicated.\\nIn the instant case, a serious dispute has been raised by the learned counsel appearing for the\\nrespective party as to whether on the face of the allegations, an offence of criminal breach of trust is\\nconstituted or not. In our view, the expression \\'entrusted with property\\' or \\'with any dominion over\\nproperty\\' has been used in wide sense in Section 405 I.P.C. Such expression includes all case in\\nwhich goods are entrusted, that is, voluntarily handed over for a specific purpose and dishonestly\\ndisposed of in violation of law or in violation of contract. The expression \\'entrusted appearing in\\nSection 405 I.P.C. is not necessarily a term of law. It has wide and different implication in different\\ncontext. It is, however, necessary that the ownership or beneficial interest in the ownership of the\\nproperty entrusted in respect of which offence is alleged to have been committed must be in some\\nperson other than the accused and the latter must hold it on account of some person or in some way\\nfor his benefit. The expression \\'Trust\\' in Section 405 I.P.C. is a comprehensive expression and has\\nbeen used to denote various kinds of relationship like the relationship of trustee and beneficiary,\\nbailer and bailee, master and servant, pledger and pledger. When some goods are hypothecated by a\\nperson to another person. the ownership of the goods still remains with the person who has\\nhypothecated such goods. The property in respect of which criminal breach of trust can be\\ncommitted must necessarily be the property of some person other than the accused or the beneficial\\ninterest in or ownership of it must be in other person and the offender must hold such property in\\ntrust for such other person or for his benefit. In a case of pledge, the pledged article belongs to some\\nother person or for his benefit. In a case of Pledge, the pledged article belongs to some other person\\nbut the same is kept in trust by the pledgee. In the instant case, a floating charge was made on the\\ngoods by way of security to cover up credit facility. In our view, in such case for disposing of the\\ngoods covering the security to cover up credit facility. In our view, In such case for disposing of the\\ngoods covering the security to cover up credit facility. In our view, in such case for disposing of the\\ngoods covering the security against credit facility the offence of criminal breach of trust is not\\ncommitted. In the facts and circumstances of the case, it, however, appears to us that the\\nRespondents moved the High Court only in 1991 although the first Fir was filed in 1987 and the\\nsecond was filed in 1989. The CBI, therefore, Got sufficient time to complete the investigation for\\nthe purpose of framing the charge.\\nAlthough Mr. Tulsi, the learned Additional Solicitor General, is justified in his submission that a\\nparticular act may constitute both civil wrong as well as criminal wrong and merely because a civil\\naction is also pursued, it does not render the criminal action impermissible, in the facts of the case,\\nit appears to us that long after the completion of civil suits, the further investigation in connection\\nwith the complaints may not be expedient. It may be noted that the opinion given by the Senior\\nManager (Legal) that the credit facility which was given to DAIL for its tobacoo division should be\\ntransferred to the newly formed Company, namely, New Tabacoo Company Limited, cannot be held\\nto be per se malafide or illegal in vies of the provisions of Section 394 of the Companies Act. That\\napart, the legal opinion of the said Senior Manager (Legal) was placed for consideration by theCentral Bureau Of Investigation, ... vs Duncans Agro Industries Ltd.,Calcutta on 9 July, 1996\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/980208/ 14highest administrative body of the bank i.e. the Board that the credit liability which stood in favour\\nof DAIL should be transferred in favour of the New Tobacoo Company Limited. In the aforesaid\\ncircumstances, it appears to use that even if the Senior Manager (Legal) or any other officer of the\\nbank had not acted properly, in view of the fact that the ultimate decision was taken by the Board of\\nDirectors, it cannot be reasonably held that some of the Officers of the Bank connived and misled\\nthe Board. It may be noted that no allegation has been made against the members of the Board.\\nIn the facts of the case, it appears to use that there is enough justification for the High Court to hold\\nthat the case was basically a matter of civil dispute. It Banks had already filed suits for recovery of\\nthe dues of the Banks on account of credit facility and said suits have been compromised on\\nreceiving the payments from the concerned Companies. Even if an offence of cheating is prima facie\\nconstituted, such offence is compoundable offence and compromise decrees passed in the suits\\ninstituted by the banks, for all intents and purposes, amount to compounding of the offence of\\ncheating. It is also to be noted that long time has elapsed since the complaint was filed in 1987. It\\nmay also be indicated that although such FIRs were filed in 1987 and 1989, the Banks have not\\nchosen to institute any case against the alleged erring official despite allegations made against them\\nin the FIRs. Considering that the investigations had not been completed till 1991 even though there\\nwas no impediment to complete the investigations and further investigations are still pending and\\nalso considering the fact that the claims of the Banks have been compromised on receiving\\npayments, we do not think that the said complaints should be pursued any further, In our view\\nproceeding further with the complaints will not be expedient. In the special facts of the case, it\\nappears to us the decision of the High Court in quashing the complaints does not warrant any\\ninterference under Article 136 of the Constitution. We, therefore, dismiss these appeals.Central Bureau Of Investigation, ... vs Duncans Agro Industries Ltd.,Calcutta on 9 July, 1996\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/980208/ 15Smt.

Wadhwa, J.\\nLeave granted.\\nThis is wife\\'s appeal against the judgment dated October 14, 1996 of the High Court\\nof Judicature at Allahabad. She is aggrieved by the impugned judgment under which\\nshe was awarded maintenance pendente lite under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage\\nAct, 1955 (for short `the Act\\') at the rate of Rs. 1500/- per month. On an application\\nfiled by the wife in the trial court in proceeding for divorce initiated by her husband,\\nrespondent No.3 herein, she was awarded Rs. 2,500/- (Rupees two thousand and five\\nhundred only) as expenses of litigation and maintenance pendente lite at the rate of\\nRs. 1000/- per month. Her revision before the District Judge Dehradun against this\\norder was dismissed. She further filed writ petition under Article 227 of the\\nConstitution of India in the High Court. By the impugned judgment the High Court\\nenhanced the maintenance to Rs. 1500/- per month.\\nRespondent 1 and 2 in this appeal are respectively the District Judge, Dehradun and\\nthe Additional Civil Judge (IInd), Dehradun who are described as proforma\\nrespondents.\\nIt is not proper or even justified on the part of the appellant to implead the courts as respondents\\nand respondents 1 and 2 are, therefore, struck off from the record of this appeal.\\nParties were married on October 2, 1963. The husband at that time was an army officer. He retired\\nand Lt. Colonel on August 10, 1986. On September 28, 1989 he filed the petition for divorce against\\nhis wife under Section 13 of the Act on the alleged grounds of cruelty and desertion. He stated that\\nwithin two years of the marriage the wife started creating problem for him and she persisted in her\\nbehaviour right till the year 1989. In this span of 26 years in their married life, they have become the\\nparents of four children, two sons and two daughters. Eldest daughter who is 34 years old and\\nunmarried is living with her mother who maintains her. Second child is so who is working with\\nMukul Overseas Pvt. Ltd. on a monthly salary of Rs. 7500/- per month and is living in a house in\\nSafdarjung Enclave in New Delhi. Third child is a daughter aged 26 years. She is also unmarried and\\nunemployed and is living with the father. Fourth child is a son of 20 years of age, he is unemployed\\nand had studied upto 11th class. Husband says that being head of the family he is to maintain two\\nsons and a daughter as they are dependent on him. His claim is that he is presently having a meagre\\nsalary of Rs. 5000/- per month and is employed as consultant/adviser with M/s. Mukul\\nInternational Private Limited. Both Mukul Overseas (P) Ltd. and Mukul International (P) Ltd.Smt. Jasbir Kaur Sehgal vs The District Judge Dehradun & Ors on 27 August, 1997\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/796258/ 2belong to same group.\\nAfter retirement from the army, respondent-husband joined the Oil and Natural Gas Commission\\n(ONGC) as a Director and was posted at Dehradun. He retired from that post on August 21, 1995.\\nThereafter from January 1, 1996 husband is working with M/s. Mukul International Pvt. Ltd. as\\naforesaid. After deduction of income-tax at source, husband says he is getting an amount of Rs.\\n4700/- per month. Husband admits that he has a house in NOIDA which was on rent with the army\\nand lease was terminated by letter dated January 29, 1996 from the Ministry of Defence. He says\\nrepairs are being carried on in the house and presently he is living with her eldest son in his house.\\nHe further says he is not getting any pension as on his permanent absorption in ONGC, he had\\nopted to receive lumpsum amount in lieu of pension and prorata gratuity amount in lieu of pension\\nand prorata gratuity amounting to Rs. 2,60,456/-. In addition the husband also received an amount\\nof Rs. 55,775/- on account of D.C.R. Gty. Husband has also filed his computation of taxable income\\nfor the assessment years 1992- 93, 1995-96 and 1996-97. He has though not filed any assessment\\norder. Since he retired from ONGC in August, 1995 it would be appropriate to see his computation\\nof taxable income for the year ending March 31, 1995. His gross salary income in Rs. 1,88,281/- and\\nafter deduction of House Rent Allowance it comes to Rs. 1,78,614. Income from house property he\\nsay is Rs. 22716/-, interest income is Rs. 3179/-. Total of these three items would be Rs. 2,04,509/-.\\nThen there are claims of standard deduction, repairs in the house and tax rebate on saving\\namounting to Rs. 68,922/- which include payment on account of LIC, PF, PPF, MEP, NSC and\\ngeneral insurance. The amount of tax payable comes to Rs. 35716/- on a taxable income of Rs.\\n1,81,790/-. For the assessment year 1996-97 (year ending on March 31, 1996) the salary income\\nshown is 1,18,151/-, income from house property is Rs. 18, 930/- and after standard deduction, and\\nother deduction and the rebate the income tax payable is Rs. 18, 464/- on the net income of Rs.\\n1,31,200/-.\\nWife says that the husband has not given true account of his assets and income and has rather\\nsuppressed the same. Though the wife has not been able to give any specific evidence to support her\\ncontention but circumstance show that the husband has not given true state of affairs of his income.\\nHe has pleaded that both his wife and his eldest daughter are earning Rs. 10,000/- per month but\\nthere is no basis for such an allegation. The fact remains that the wife has no source of income and\\nshe is also maintaining her eldest unmarried daughter. Under the Hindu Adoptions & Maintenance\\nAct, 1956 it is the obligation of a person to maintain her unmarried daughter if she is unable to\\nmaintain herself. In this case since the wife has no income of her own, it is the obligation of the\\nhusband to maintain her and her two unmarried daughters one of whom is living with wife and one\\nwith him. Section 24 of the Act no doubt talks of maintenance of wife during the pendency of the\\nproceedings but this section, in our view, cannot be read in isolation and cannot be given restricted\\nmeaning to hold that it is maintenance of the wife alone and no one else. Since wife is maintaining\\nthe eldest unmarried daughter, her right to claim maintenance would include her own maintenance\\nand that of her daughter. This fact has to be kept in view while fixing the maintenance pendente lite\\nfor the wife. We are aware of the provisions of Section 26 of the Act providing for custody of minor\\nchildren, their maintenance and education but that section operates in its own field.Smt. Jasbir Kaur Sehgal vs The District Judge Dehradun & Ors on 27 August, 1997\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/796258/ 3Husband has filed this counter affidavit in the appeal before us and on our direction both the parties\\nhave filed additional affidavits. On one date when this appeal came up for hearing we were told that\\nthe husband had left that morning itself for Canada for further treatment after his bypass surgery in\\nIndia and that his expenses visiting the Canada and as well as the expenses for the treatment there\\nwere being met by his friend. In his affidavit husband has stated that his friend Sontosh Singh for\\nhis treatment in Canada paid his fare. He is, however, silent about the expense if any met by Sontosh\\nSingh for his treatment in Canada. A copy of the statutory declaration of Sontosh Singh which is\\ndated March 21, 1997 has also been filed. In this Sontosh Singh does say that he has undertaken to\\nbear the cost of passage and maintenance of respondent during his stay in Canada and North\\nAmerica. It is a matter of common knowledge that medical treatment in Canada is high and an\\nordinary person cannot afford the expenses which are met by taking medical insurance. As to what\\nexpenses husband incurred for his bypass surgery in India has not been disclosed. On our query as\\nto how much foreign exchange husband obtained while going to Canada, it was stated that Dollar\\nU.S. 1,350 were obtained at a cost of about Rs. 50,000/-. From where all these monies came from\\nwe are left in dark. Husband had not filed any certificate of his salary from his present employer\\nthough the wife has contended that both the firms Mukul Overseas Pvt. Ltd and Mukul International\\nPvt. Ltd. are owned by the husband himself which fact husband had denied. Though we are not\\nconcerned with the income of his son which is stated to be Rs. 7,500/- per month, it would have\\nbeen better if the husband had given complete details as to the perquisites enjoyed by his son, the\\nrent he is paying for his rented accommodation at Safdarjung Enclave and the like. Claim of the\\nhusband that though his house in NOIDA fell vacant in January, 1996, it has neither been further let\\nnor the husband himself living there because of certain repairs and on that account he is residing\\nwith his son does not appeal to us. It does appear to us from the affidavit of the husband that it\\nconceals more than what it tells of his income and other assets. Attempt has been made to conceal\\nhis true income and that leads us to draw an adverse inference against the husband about his\\nincome that it is much more than what is being disclosed to us. The claim of the husband that from\\nan income of Rs. 4,750/- per month which is getting from Mukul International Pvt. Ltd. he has to\\nmaintain himself, his two sons and daughter is absorb particularly when the eldest son is earning\\nmore than the husband and it is the husband who is living with him. Husband has also not disclosed\\nretrial benefits if any from the ONGC and the amount of provident fund he obtained from there.\\nHusband has interest income from Unit Trust of India and also from the fixed deposit receipt but\\nagain he has not disclosed the number of units he is holding and the amount of the fixed deposits in\\nhis name, from all these we have to hold that the annual income of the respondent-husband is even\\non modest estimate to be Rs. 2,40,000/- annually which would come to Rs. 20,000/- per month.\\nConsidering the diverse claims made by the parties one inflating the income and the other\\nsuppressing an element of conjecture and guess work does enter for arriving at the income of the\\nhusband. It cannot be done by any mathematical precision.\\nWife has no fixed abode of residence She say she is living in Gurudwara with her eldest daughter for\\nsafety. On the other hand husband has sufficient income and a house to him. Wife has not claimed\\nand litigation expenses in this appeal. She is aggrieved only because of the paltry amount of\\nmaintenance fixed by the court. No set formula can be laid for fixing the amount of maintenance. It\\nhas, in very nature of things, to depend on the facts and circumstance of each case. Some scope for\\nliverage can, however, be always there. Court has to consider the status of the parties, theirSmt. Jasbir Kaur Sehgal vs The District Judge Dehradun & Ors on 27 August, 1997\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/796258/ 4respective needs, capacity of the husband to pay having regard to his reasonable expenses for his\\nown maintenance and those; he is obliged under the law and statutory but involuntary payments or\\ndeductions. Amount of maintenance fixed for the wife should be such as she can live in reasonable\\ncomfort considering her status and the mode of life she was used to when she lived with her\\nhusband and also that she does not feel handicapped in the prosecution of her case. At the same\\ntime, the amount so fixed cannot be excessive or extortionate. In the circumstances of the present\\ncase we fix maintenance pendente lite at the rate of Rs. 5,000/- per month payable by\\nrespondent-husband to the appellant-wife.\\nThe question then arises as to from which date the wife would be entitled to claim the enhanced\\namount of maintenance pendente lite. If wife has no source of income it is the obligation of the\\nhusband to maintain her and also children of the marriage on the basis of the provision contained in\\nthe Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956. Her right to claim maintenance fructifies on the\\ndate of the filing of the petition for divorce under the Act. Having thus fixed the date as the filing of\\nthe petition for divorce it is not always that the court has to grant the maintenance from that date.\\nThe court has discretion in the matter as to from which date maintenance under Section 24 of the\\nAct should be granted. The discretion of the court would depend upon multiple circumstance which\\nare to be kept in view. These could be the time taken to serve the respondent in the petition the date\\nof filing of the application under Section 241 of the Act; conduct of the parties in the proceedings;\\naverments made in the application and the reply there to; the tendency of the wife to inflate the\\nincome out of all proportion and that of the husband to suppress the same; and the like. There has\\nto be honesty of purpose for both the parties which unfortunately we find lacking in this case. We\\nare therefore of the opinion that ends of justice would be met if we direct that maintenance\\npendente lite as fixed by this judgment to be payable from the date of impugned order of the High\\nCourt which is October 16, 1996. We order accordingly. The impugned judgment of the High Court\\nshall stand modified to that extent. All arrears of maintenance shall be paid within a period of two\\nmonths from today and then regularly every month.\\nThe appeal is allowed with costs. Counsel fee Rs. 2,500/-.Smt.

Leave granted. The appellants are public-spirited individuals, concerned about the adverse\\nprecedent set by the imposition of certain bail conditions in a case involving a sexual offence against\\na woman; they impugn a part of the judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court1 that imposed\\nthese bail conditions. With the consent of counsel for the parties, the appeal was heard finally. TheAparna Bhat vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 18 March, 2021\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13024806/ 1appellants also filed an 1 In Vikram v. The State of Madhya Pradeshin MCRC 23350/ 2020, dated\\n30.7.2020 application2, seeking directions that all the High Courts and trial Courts be directed to\\nrefrain from making observations and imposing conditions in rape and sexual assault cases, at any\\nstage of judicial proceedings, that trivialize the trauma undergone by survivors and adversely affect\\ntheir dignity. Certain intervenors also preferred an application in support of the appeal, seeking\\nclear directions to all Courts to refrain from imposing “irrelevant, freaky or illegal bail conditions”.\\n2. Ibsen, the prescient nineteenth century author, made a powerful statement (quoted as the\\nepigram at the beginning of this judgment); sadly, even today, in the twenty first century, after 70\\nyears as a republic with the goal of equality for all, many courts seem to be oblivious of the problem.\\nIn a sense, this judgment is not as much about only the merits of the impugned conditions of the\\nbail order, but is meant to address a wider canvas of (what appears to be) entrenched paternalistic\\nand misogynistic attitudes that are regrettably reflected at times in judicial orders and judgments.\\n3. The brief facts of the case are that on 20.04.2020 at about 2.30 a.m., the accused-applicant, a\\nneighbour of the complainant, entered her house and caught hold of the complainant’s hand, and\\nallegedly attempted to harass her sexually. Accordingly, Crime No. 133/2020 was registered at\\nPolice Station, Bhatpachlana, District-Ujjain for the offences punishable under sections 452, 354A3,\\n323 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The case was investigated and a charge sheet was filed.\\nThe accused filed an application under Section 438 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereafter\\n“CrPC”) seeking pre-arrest bail. The High Court, by the impugned 3Section 354A reads as follows:\\n“354A. Sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment.— (1) A man\\ncommitting any of the following acts—\\n(i) physical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures;\\nor\\n(ii) a demand or request for sexual favours; or\\n(iii) showing pornography against the will of a woman; or\\n(iv) making sexually coloured remarks, shall be guilty of the offence of sexual\\nharassment. (2) Any man who commits the offence specified in clause (i) or clause\\n(ii) or clause (iii) of sub-section (1) shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for\\na term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.\\n(3) Any man who commits the offence specified in clause (iv) of sub-section (1) shall\\nbe punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to\\none year, or with fine, or with both.” order, even while granting bail to the applicant\\nimposed the following condition which is under challenge in this petition.\\n(i) “The applicant along with his wife shall visit the house of the complainant with\\nRakhi thread/ band on 3rd August, 2020 at 11:00 a.m. with a box of sweets andAparna Bhat vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 18 March, 2021\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13024806/ 2request the complainant -Sarda Bai to tie the Rakhi band to him with the promise to\\nprotect her to the best of his ability for all times to come. He shall also tender Rs.\\n11,000/- to the complainant as a customary ritual usually offered by the brothers to\\nsisters on such occasion and shall also seek her blessings. The applicant shall also\\ntender Rs. 5,000/- to the son of the complainant – Vishal for purchase of clothes and\\nsweets. The applicant shall obtain photographs and receipts of payment made to the\\ncomplainant and her son, and the same shall be filed through the counsel for placing\\nthe same on record of this case before this Registry. The aforesaid deposit of amount\\nshall not influence the pending trial, but is only for enlargement of the applicant on\\nbail.”\\n4. The appellants submit that the expressions “in the interest of justice”, “such other conditions\\ncourt considers necessary” and “as it may think fit” as provided in the bare text of the Section\\n437(3)(c) as well as Section 438(2)(iv) of the CrPC, give discretion to the Courts to impose such\\nother conditions as may be required in the facts of a particular case, but those conditions have to be\\nin consonance with the other conditions in the provisions, the purpose of granting bail and no other\\nconsideration.\\n5. The appellants cite Kunal Kumar Tiwari v. State of Bihar4 and Sumit Mehta v. State (NCT of\\nDelhi)5 and argue that this court’s observations in those decisions must be followed by every court\\nwhile considering and dealing with bail applications. They also rely on the observations made in\\npara 18 of State of M.P v. Madanlal,6 and urge that in cases of sexual offences, the idea of\\ncompromise, especially in the form of marriage between the accused and the prosecutrix is\\nabhorrent, and should not be considered a judicial remedy, as it would be antithetical to the\\nwoman’s honour and dignity. Likewise, reliance was placed on Ramphal v. State of Haryana7, where\\nthe 4 (2018) 16 SCC 74 5 (2013) 15 SCC 570 6 (2015) 7 SCC 681 7Crl. A. No. 438/2011decided on\\n27.11.2019 court took note of the compromise between the survivor and accused, but found that\\nsuch compromise is of no relevance when deciding on cases of rape and sexual assault.\\n6. The appellants brought to the notice of this Court, various decisions and orders where the\\nobservations made by the judges in offences against women including cases under the Protection of\\nChildren from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO) were extraneous. The appellants submitted that\\nthe courts, in many cases, especially under the POCSO Act, granted bail on the plea that an\\nagreement to marry had been reached between the accused and prosecutrix. Additionally, they also\\nsubmitted that while adjudicating matters of sexual harassment and rape, judges have made\\nshocking remarks on the character of the prosecutrix.\\n7. Reference is made to Ravi Jatav v. State of M.P8, where the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, while\\ngranting bail (to an accused of committing offences under Sections 376-D, 366, 506, 34 IPC)\\nimposed conditions that the accused “shall register himself as a Covid-19 Warrior” and was to be\\nassigned work of Covid-19 disaster management at the discretion of the District Magistrate. In\\nRakesh B. v. State of Karnataka9, the Karnataka High Court granted bail to an accused alleged to\\nhave committed offences under Sections 376, 420, 506 IPC and Section 66-B of the Information\\nTechnology Act, 2000 (“IT Act”), and made remarks on the survivor’s conduct.

The appellants submit that this is unacceptable and no observation/condition should\\nbe made which permits the accused to meet/have access to the survivor and her family members.\\n9. The appellants also cite Mohan v. State10, where the Madras High Court had referred the case of\\nrape of a minor to mediation and observed that the case was fit for attempting a compromise\\nbetween the parties. Likewise, Samuvel v. Inspector of Police11is cited, where the High Court of\\nMadras referred to mediation, a case of rape where the prosecutrix was a minor and had become a\\nmother of a child as a consequence of rape, because the accused agreed to marry her. It is urged that\\nno observation/condition should be made which initiates or encourages compromise that disparages\\nand downgrades an otherwise heinous crime thus indicating that such offences are remediable by\\nway of a compromise/ by marriage.\\n10.

Vikas Garg v. State of Haryana15, by the High Court of Punjab is cited, where the court granted\\nbail to three persons accused of committing offences under Sections 376D, 376(2)(n), 376, 292,\\n120-B, 506 IPC and Section 67 of the IT Act, and made observations regarding the prosecutrix’s\\n“casual relationships”,“promiscuous attitude”, “voyeuristic mind”, etc. The appellants submit that\\nno observation/condition should be made which grants bail on the ground that the victim is of\\n“loose character” or is “habituated to sexual intercourse.”\\n12. Counsel for the Intervenors submitted that under sections 437(2) and 438, the power to impose\\nconditions have been expressed in very wide terms by using the phrase “any condition.” Recently,\\nHigh Courts while granting bail under these sections have started imposing irrelevant conditions.\\nThe Intervenors have annexed around twenty-three orders in which such conditions for bail were\\nimposed. They argue that the conditions that can be imposed under the law are clearly laid down by\\nthe Supreme Court in the case of Munish Bhasin v. State16 and reiterated in Parvez Noordin\\nLokhandwalla v. State of Maharashtra.17 Accordingly, it is clear that imposing conditions like\\nrendering community service in COVID hospitals or in any other institution, plantation of trees,\\ncontributing to any particular charity relief fund, etc. is impermissible in law. The Intervenors\\nfurther submit that the accused, during pendency of the trial are presumed innocent and their guilt\\nis as yet to be adjudicated by the Court. Imposition of conditions like compulsive community\\nservice, etc. is violative of the right to equality and personal liberty, including procedure established\\nby law in the Indian Constitution.\\n13. The Intervenors also submit that the Court while deciding a bail application, cannot assume the\\nrole of a social reformer or fund raiser for charities and impose 15Cr. M. No. 23962/2017, order\\ndated 13.09.2017 passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court 16(2009) 4 SCC 45 17(2020) 10\\nSCC 77 conditions which have no nexus with the offense or relevance with the object of the bail\\nprovisions.\\n14. It was submitted that in IA No. 102226/2020, the appellants have brought to the notice of this\\nCourt, several other instances in which similar directions have been made by High Courts and Trial\\nCourts across the country. Such wide prevalence necessitates the urgent intervention of this Court to\\nfirstly, declare that such remarks are unacceptable and have the potential to cause grave harm to the\\nprosecutrix and the society at large, secondly, reiterate that judicial orders have to conform to\\ncertain judicial standards, and thirdly, take necessary steps to ensure that this does not happen in\\nthe future.\\n15. It was further submitted that this Court should intervene and issue directions or guidelines on\\nbail and anticipatory bail to ensure that courts impose only those conditions as are permissible in\\nlaw. Further, this Court was urged to issue directions on gender sensitization of the bar and the\\nbench, particularly with regard to judicial empathy for the prosecutrix.\\n16. The learned Attorney General, who had been issued notice in this matter, made his submissions\\nin support of the appeal; he also filed a detailed note suggesting the steps that should be taken to\\nsensitize all stakeholders, especially courts, while dealing with offences against women. Highlighting\\nthe observations made in Kunal Kumar (supra), Sumit Mehta (supra), State of Punjab v. GurmitAparna Bhat vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 18 March, 2021\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13024806/ 5Singh18 and Sakshi v. State19, the learned Attorney General submitted that while relying upon the\\nobservations made in the above-mentioned cases, the court may highlight that in cases of crimes\\nagainst women, the following additional considerations may be kept in mind:\\ni. Bail conditions should not mandate or even permit contact between the accused\\nand the victim.\\n18 (1996) 2 SCC 384 19 (2004) 5 SCC 518 ii. Bail conditions must seek to protect the\\ncomplainant from any harassment by the accused.\\niii. Where considered necessary, the complainant/prosecutrix may be heard on whether there is any\\npeculiar circumstance which may require additional conditions for her protection.\\niv. Wherever bail is granted, the complainant may immediately be informed that the accused has\\nbeen granted bail.\\nv. Bail conditions must be free from stereotypical or patriarchal notions on women and their place in\\nsociety, and must strictly be in accordance with the requirements of the CrPC.\\nvi. The Courts while adjudicating a case, should not suggest or entertain any notions (or encourage\\nany step) towards compromises between the prosecutrix and the accused to get married, as it is\\nbeyond their powers and jurisdiction.\\n17. On gender equality and gender sensitization, the Attorney General argued that to achieve the\\ngoal of gender justice, it is imperative that judicial officers, judges, and members of the bar are made\\naware of gender prejudices that hinder justice. Accordingly, he submitted that the foremost aspect to\\nfacilitate a gender sensitive approach, is to train judges to exercise their discretion and avoid the use\\nof gender- based stereotypes while deciding cases pertaining to sexual offences. Secondly, judges\\nshould have sensitivity to the concerns of the survivor of sexual offences.\\n18. Reliance was placed on the Bangkok General Guidance for Judges on Applying a Gender\\nPerspective in South East Asia, by the International Commission of Jurists. It was pointed out that\\nthe following stereotypes are often encountered in the course of judicial decision-making and should\\nbe avoided: -\\ni. Women are physically weak;\\nii. Women cannot make decisions on their own;\\niii. Men are the head of the household and must make all the decisions related to\\nfamily;\\niv. Women should be submissive and obedient;\\n v.    Good women are sexually chaste;Aparna Bhat vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 18 March, 2021\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13024806/ 6 vi.   Every woman wants to be a mother;\\n vii. Women should be the ones in charge of their children;\\nviii. Being alone at night or wearing certain clothes make women responsible for\\nbeing attacked;\\nix. Women are emotional and often overreact or dramatize hence it is necessary to\\ncorroborate their testimony;\\nx. Testimonial evidence provided by women who are sexually active may be suspected\\nwhen assessing “consent” in sexual offence cases; and xi. Lack of evidence of physical\\nharm in sexual offense case means consent was given.\\n19. The Attorney General submitted that training for gender sensitization for judges at all levels of\\nthe judiciary should mandatorily be conducted at regular intervals by the National Judicial Academy\\nand State Judicial Academies. He emphasized that any directions towards gender sensitization\\nshould include judges of all levels of the judiciary. Further, the counsel urged that courses on gender\\nsensitization should be included in the curriculum of law schools, and the All-India Bar Exam\\nshould include questions on gender sensitization as well. In addition to this, he recommended that a\\ndetailed curriculum may be prepared with the help of subject matter experts by each High Court, to\\nbe a part of the syllabus for the Judicial Services Exams and training for inducted judges.\\nNature of the beast20: the problem\\n20. Women often experience obstacles in gaining access to mechanisms of redress, including legal\\naid, counselling services and shelters. They are re-victimized and exposed to further risk of violence\\nthrough the denial of redress in the context of informal trials or negotiations between families and\\ncommunity leaders. The payment of financial compensation by the perpetrator or his family for acts\\nof violence against women, in lieu of legal remedies, was a recurrent concern vis-à-vis the formal\\nand informal justice systems. Violence against women in India is systematic and occurs in 20 A\\nphrase that means the traits inherent to a thing or situation, especially a negative or difficult one\\n(See https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/the+nature+of+the+beast) the public and private\\nspheres. It is underpinned by the persistence of patriarchal social norms and inter- and intra-gender\\nhierarchies. Women are discriminated against and subordinated not only on the basis of sex, but on\\nother grounds too, such as caste, class, ability, sexual orientation, tradition and other realities.21\\n21. Gender violence is most often unseen and is shrouded in a culture of silence. The causes and\\nfactors of violence against women include entrenched unequal power equations between men and\\nwomen that foster violence and its acceptability, aggravated by cultural and social norms, economic\\ndependence, poverty and alcohol consumption, etc. In India, the culprits are often known to the\\nwoman; the social and economic \"costs\" of reporting such crimes are high. General economicAparna Bhat vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 18 March, 2021\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13024806/ 7dependence on family and fear of social ostracization act as significant disincentives for women to\\nreport any kind of sexual violence, abuse or abhorrent behaviour. Therefore, the actual incidence of\\nviolence against women in India is probably much higher than the data suggests, and women may\\ncontinue to face hostility and have to remain in environments where they are subject to violence.\\nThis silence needs to be broken. In doing so, men, perhaps more than women have a duty and role\\nto play in averting and combating violence against women.\\n22. Unlike many other victims of interpersonal crimes such as theft, robbery or muggings, survivors\\nof sexual assault are vulnerable to being blamed for their attack, and thus victim-blaming (overtly or\\nin more subtle forms) in sexual assault cases has been the focus of several writings. Myths and\\nstereotypes “underlie and fuel sexual violence against women and inform negative societal\\nreactions”.22 Joanne Conaghan points out pertinently that “removing the doctrinal debris of a\\nlegally instituted gendered hierarchical order does not necessarily get rid of deeply ingrained social\\n21Report of the Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, its Causes and Consequences, on\\nher Mission to India (22 April to 1 May, 2013) A/HRC/26/38/Add.1 (accessible at www.ohchr.org ›\\nDocuments › A-HRC-26-38-Add1_en) 22 Shannon Sampert, \"Let Me Tell You a Story:\\nEnglish-Canadian Newspapers and Sexual Assault Myths\" (2010) 22:2 Canadian Journal of Women\\nand the Law 301 at 304; also Janice Du Mont, and Deborah Parmis; \"Judging Women: The\\nPernicious Effects of Rape Mythology” (1999) 19:1-2 Canadian Woman Studies 102 at 102 and\\ncultural attitudes which law has long endorsed and which continue to infuse the criminal justice\\nprocess, albeit in more covert, less accessible forms.”23\\n23. Sexual violence is varied in degree. At the highest (or, rather most aggravated) level, is rape with\\nor without attendant violence. However, there are a substantial number of incidents which fall\\nwithin the rubric of sexual violence, that amount to offences under various penal enactments. These\\noutlaw behaviours such as stalking, eve-teasing, shades of verbal and physical assault, and\\nharassment. Social attitudes typically characterize this latter category of crimes as “minor” offences.\\nSuch “minor” crimes are, regrettably not only trivialised or normalized, rather they are even\\nromanticized and therefore, invigorated in popular lore such as cinema. These attitudes – which\\nindulgently view the crime through prisms such as “boys will be boys” and condone them,\\nnevertheless have a lasting and pernicious effect on the survivors.\\n24. The United Nations Organisation has defined “violence against women” as “any act of gender\\nbased violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or\\nsuffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty,\\nwhether occurring in public or private life.”24 The effect of offensive behaviour against women,\\nwhich laws criminalize-\\n23 Joanne Conaghan, Law and Gender (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013) at 113 24The\\nDeclaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women (also ‘DEVAW). Articles 1 and 2 read as\\nfollows:\\n“Article One:Aparna Bhat vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 18 March, 2021\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13024806/ 8For the purposes of this Declaration, the term “violence against women” means any\\nact of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or\\npsychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or\\narbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.\\nArticle Two:\\nViolence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the\\nfollowing:\\n(a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including\\nbattering, sexual abuse of female children in the household, dowry-related violence,\\nmarital rape, female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to\\nwomen, non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation;\\n(b) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring within the general\\ncommunity, including rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at\\nwork, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women and forced\\nprostitution;\\n(c) Physical, sexual and psychological violence perpetrated or condoned by the State,\\nwherever it occurs.” physical, verbal, or other acts which threaten or give them acute\\ndiscomfort, undermining their dignity, self-worth and respect, is to silence or subdue\\nthe survivor.\\n25. In The Standard of Social Justice as a Research Process 25 two scholars of psychology made a\\nstrong indictment of the (contextually, Canadian) criminal justice process:\\n“The more general indictment of the current criminal justice process is that the law\\nand legal doctrines concerning sexual assault have acted as the principle [sic]\\nsystemic mechanisms for invalidating the experiences of women and children. Given\\nthis state of affairs, the traditional view of the legal system as neutral, objective and\\ngender- blind is not defensible. Since the system is ineffective in protecting the rights\\nof women and children, it is necessary to re-examine the existing doctrines which\\nreflect the cultural and social limitations that have preserved dominant male\\ninterests at the expense of women and children.” Previous rulings\\n26. In Kunal Kumar Tiwari v. State of Bihar (supra), this court while dealing with Section 437(3)(c),\\nCr. PC (general conditions of bail) observed as follows:\\n“9. There is no dispute that Sub-clause (c) of Section 437(3) allows Courts to impose\\nsuch conditions in the interest of justice. We are aware that palpably such wordings\\nare capable of accepting broader meaning. But such conditions cannot be arbitrary,\\nfanciful or extend beyond the ends of the provision. The phrase \\'interest of justice\\' asAparna Bhat vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 18 March, 2021\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13024806/ 9used under the Sub-clause (c) of Section 437(3) means \"good administration of\\njustice\" or \"advancing the trial process\" and inclusion of broader meaning should be\\nshunned because of purposive interpretation.”\\n27. In Sumit Mehta v. State (NCT of Delhi) (supra) this court, with respect to the conditions that can\\nbe imposed validly under section 438(2) of the CrPC, observed that:\\n“11. While exercising power under Section 438 of the Code, the Court is duty bound to\\nstrike a balance between the individual\\'s right to 25(1997), 38 Can. Psychology 91, K.\\nE. Renner, C. Alksnis and L. Park at p. 100 personal freedom and the right of\\ninvestigation of the police. For the same, while granting relief Under Section 438(1),\\nappropriate conditions can be imposed Under Section 438(2) so as to ensure an\\nuninterrupted investigation. The object of putting such conditions should be to avoid\\nthe possibility of the person hampering the investigation. Thus, any condition, which\\nhas no reference to the fairness or propriety of the investigation or trial, cannot be\\ncountenanced as permissible under the law. So, the discretion of the Court while\\nimposing conditions must be exercised with utmost restraint.”\\n28. It was urged that the observations made in Kunal Kumar and Sumit Mehta ought to be followed\\nwhile imposing bail conditions. The appellants relying upon the observations made in para 18 of\\nState of M.P v. Madanlal,26 submit that in cases of sexual offences, the concept of compromise,\\nespecially in the form of marriage between the accused and the prosecutrix shall not be thought of,\\nas any such attempt would be offensive to the woman’s dignity.\\n“18. …We would like to clearly state that in a case of rape or attempt of rape, the conception of\\ncompromise under no circumstances can really be thought of. These are crimes against the body of a\\nwoman which is her own temple. These are offences which suffocate the breath of life and sully the\\nreputation. And reputation, needless to emphasise, is the richest jewel one can conceive of in life. No\\none would allow it to be extinguished. When a human frame is defiled, the “purest treasure”, is lost.\\nDignity of a woman is a part of her non- perishable and immortal self and no one should ever think\\nof painting it in clay. There cannot be a compromise or settlement as it would be against her honour\\nwhich matters the most. It is sacrosanct. Sometimes solace is given that the perpetrator of the crime\\nhas acceded to enter into wedlock with her which is nothing but putting pressure in an adroit\\nmanner; and we say with emphasis that the Courts are to remain absolutely away from this\\nsubterfuge to adopt a soft approach to the case, for any kind of liberal approach has to be put in the\\ncompartment of spectacular error. Or to put it differently, it would be in the realm of a sanctuary of\\nerror.” 26 (2015) 7 SCC 681\\n29. The decision in Ramphal v. State of Haryana27 by order dated 27.11.2019, took note of the\\ncompromise between the survivor and accused persons but found that such compromise is of no\\nrelevance when deciding on rape and cases of sexual assault.\\n“It is brought to our notice that during the pendency of the appeals, both the appellants have paid\\nRs. 1.5 lakhs each in favor of the prosecutrix and she has accepted the same willingly for getting theAparna Bhat vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 18 March, 2021\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13024806/ 10matter compromised. However, it is imperative to emphasize that we do not accept such\\ncompromise in matters relating to the offence of rape and similar cases of sexual assault. Hence, the\\naforesaid compromise is of no relevance in deciding this matter. On merits, we do not find any\\nground to interfere in as much as the evidence of the prosecutrix is coupled with the medical\\nevidence which clearly proves that the offence of rape has been committed. Therefore, the Trial\\nCourt and the High Court have rightly convicted the accused/appellants.”\\n30. Empirically, the statistics regarding certain kinds of crimes against women have not shown any\\nsignificant decline. In states and union territories, 32033 rape cases (under Section 376 IPC) were\\nregistered in 2019; 4038 cases of attempt to rape were registered the same year (under Section 376\\nread with Section 511, IPC). As many as 88,387 cases under Section 354 IPC were registered the\\nsame year, whereas 6939 cases were registered under Section 509 (outraging the modesty of a\\nwoman) in 2019. In all, a total of 4, 05,861 crimes against women were reported in 2019 (as against\\n359849 in 2017 and 378236 in 2018). The statistic for a relatively new species of offensive activities,\\ncybercrimes that are women-centric, such as Transmitting of Sexually Explicit Material (Sec.\\n67A/67B, Information Technology Act), Blackmailing Defamation/Morphing/creating Fake Profile\\netc) registered in 2019, were 1645. POCSO offences, where girl children were victims, reported in\\n2019 were 46,005.28 The role of the courts and law enforcement agencies as neutral authorities,\\nunder a duty to ensure fairness\\n28https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/CII%202019%20Volume%201.pdf\\n31. The role of all courts is to make sure that the survivor can rely on their impartiality and\\nneutrality, at every stage in a criminal proceeding, where she is the survivor and an aggrieved party.\\nEven an indirect undermining of this responsibility cast upon the court, by permitting discursive\\nformations on behalf of the accused, that seek to diminish his agency, or underplay his role as an\\nactive participant (or perpetrator) of the crime, could in many cases, shake the confidence of the\\nrape survivor (or accuser of the crime) in the impartiality of the court. The current attitude\\nregarding crimes against women typically is that “grave” offences like rape are not tolerable and\\noffenders must be punished. This, however, only takes into consideration rape and other serious\\nforms of gender-based physical violence. The challenges Indian women face are formidable: they\\ninclude a misogynistic society with entrenched cultural values and beliefs, bias (often\\nsub-conscious) about the stereotypical role of women, social and political structures that are heavily\\nmale- centric, most often legal enforcement structures that either cannot cope with, or are unwilling\\nto take strict and timely measures. Therefore, reinforcement of this stereotype, in court utterances\\nor orders, through considerations which are extraneous to the case, would impact fairness.\\n32. Academic writings highlight that a judgment at all levels has a number of distinct audiences,\\neach of which engages with it in a different way. The parties to the case and their counsel will be\\ninterested in how the judge resolves their specific dispute - what the law gives to or requires of them.\\nAt the same time, in a legal system where judgments of courts set precedents, and in particular\\nwithin a common law system, judgments have significance beyond their authoritative resolution of a\\nspecific dispute—particularly in the Supreme Court. Thus, the judge is not only communicating to\\nthe parties their rights and liabilities in the context of the specific dispute being litigated; the judge\\nis also addressing the broader legal community— other lawyers, judges, legal academics, lawAparna Bhat vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 18 March, 2021\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13024806/ 11students—and indeed the public at large.29\\n33. Using rakhi tying as a condition for bail, transforms a molester into a brother, by a judicial\\nmandate. This is wholly unacceptable, and has the effect of diluting and eroding the offence of\\nsexual harassment. The act perpetrated on the survivor constitutes an offence in law, and is not a\\nminor transgression that can be remedied by way of an apology, rendering community service, tying\\na rakhi or presenting a gift to the survivor, or even promising to marry her, as the case may be. The\\nlaw criminalizes outraging the modesty of a woman. Granting bail, subject to such conditions,\\nrenders the court susceptible to the charge of re-negotiating and mediating justice between\\nconfronting parties in a criminal offence and perpetuating gender stereotypes.\\n34. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has noted that judicial stereotyping “is a\\ncommon and pernicious barrier to justice, particularly for women victims and survivors of violence.\\nSuch stereotyping causes judges to reach a view about cases based on preconceived beliefs, rather\\nthan relevant facts and actual enquiry.”30 Furthering of rape myths and stereotypes by the\\njudiciary, limits the emancipatory potential of the law.\\n35. ‘Judicial stereotyping’ refers to the practice of judges ascribing to an individual specific\\nattributes, characteristics or roles by reason only of her or his membership in a particular social\\ngroup (e.g. women). It is used, also, to refer to the practice of judges perpetuating harmful\\nstereotypes through their failure to challenge them, for example by lower courts or parties to legal\\nproceedings.31 Stereotyping 29Erica Rackley, The Art and Craft of Writing Judgements in Hunter,\\nRosemary and McGlynn, Clare and Rackley, Erika, eds.

There have been notable rulings by the CEDAW33 Committee in this regard. In V.K. v.\\nBulgaria34, the Committee observed that:\\n‘stereotyping affects women’s right to a fair trial and that the judiciary must be\\ncareful not to create inflexible standards based on preconceived notions of what\\nconstitutes domestic or gender-based violence’.\\n37. In Karen Tayag Vertido v. The Philippines35, the CEDAW Committee stressed that court should\\nnot create “inflexible standards” of what women should be or have done, when confronted with a\\nsituation of rape.Aparna Bhat vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 18 March, 2021\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13024806/ 1238. Judges can play a significant role in ridding the justice system of harmful stereotypes. They have\\nan important responsibility to base their decisions on law and facts in evidence, and not engage in\\ngender stereotyping. This requires judges to identify gender stereotyping, and identify how the\\napplication, enforcement or perpetuation of these stereotypes discriminates against women or\\ndenies them equal access to justice. Stereotyping might compromise the impartiality of a judge’s\\ndecision and affect his or her views about witness credibility or the culpability of the accused\\nperson.36As a judge of the Canadian Supreme Court remarked:\\n“Myths and stereotypes are a form of bias because they impair the individual judge’s\\nability to assess the facts in a particular case in an open-minded fashion. In fact,\\njudging based on myths and stereotypes is entirely incompatible with keeping an\\nopen mind, because myths 32Supra, p. 17.\\n33The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women\\n(CEDAW), was adopted in 1979 by the UN General Assembly; it is sometimes\\ndescribed as an international bill of rights for women.

The stereotype of the ideal sexual assault victim disqualifies several accounts of lived\\nexperiences of sexual assault. Rape myths38 undermine the credibility of those women who are seen\\nto deviate too far from stereotyped notions of chastity, resistance to rape, having visible physical\\ninjuries, behaving a certain way, reporting the offence immediately, etc. In the words of the\\nSupreme Court of Canada, in R v. Seaboyer,39 “The woman who comes to the attention of the\\nauthorities has her victimization measured against the current rape mythologies, i.e., who she\\nshould be in order to be recognized as having been, in the eyes of the law, raped; who her attacker\\nmust be in order to be recognized, in the eyes of the law, as a potential rapist; and how injured she\\nmust be in order to be believed.”\\n40. The Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct, 2002, were from a meeting of Chief Justices of\\nAsian and African countries, and endorsed by the UN Commission on Human Rights, the ECOSOC\\nand the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. The Bangalore Principles provide\\nthat:Aparna Bhat vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 18 March, 2021\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13024806/ 13“2.4 A judge shall not knowingly, while a proceeding is before, or could come before,\\nthe judge, make any comment that might reasonably be expected to affect the\\noutcome of such proceeding or impair the manifest fairness of the process. Nor shall\\nthe judge make any comment in public or otherwise that might affect the fair trial of\\nany person or issue.\\n******** 5.1 A judge shall be aware of, and understand, diversity in society and\\ndifferences arising from various sources, including but not limited to race, colour,\\nsex, religion, national origin, caste, disability, age, 37 The Honourable Madame\\nJustice Claire L’Heureux-Dubé, ‘Beyond the Myths: Equality, Impartiality, and\\nJustice’ (2001) 10(1) Journal of Social Distress and the Homeless 87, 88. 38\\nExplained in R. v.

This court held, in State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh & Ors.40 that:\\n“The trial court not only erroneously disbelieved the prosecutrix, but quite\\nuncharitably and unjustifiably even characterised her as a girl “of loose morals” or\\n“such type of a girl”. … We must express our strong disapproval of the approach of\\nthe trial court and its casting a stigma on the character of the prosecutrix. The\\nobservations lack sobriety expected of a judge. … The courts are expected to use self-\\nrestraint while recording such findings which have larger repercussions so far as the\\nfuture of the victim of the sex crime is concerned and even wider implications on the\\nsociety as a whole – where the victim of crime is discouraged – the criminal\\nencouraged and in turn crime gets rewarded!’ ***** “Language is \\'a medium of social\\naction\\' not \\'merely a vehicle of communication\\' and the written judicial opinion is the\\nprimary, if not the sole, medium in which judges within our judicial system execute\\nlanguage.”41 ***** …the text of judicial decisions and opinions constitutes the law by\\nwhich our common law system abides and the basis on which judges, lawyers, and\\ncitizens make reasoned legal judgments about future action.”42Aparna Bhat vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 18 March, 2021\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13024806/ 1442. This Court therefore holds that the use of reasoning/language which diminishes the offence and\\ntends to trivialize the survivor, is especially to be avoided under all circumstances. Thus, the\\nfollowing conduct, actions or situations are hereby deemed irrelevant, e.g. - to say that the survivor\\nhad in the past consented to such or similar acts or that she behaved promiscuously, or by her acts\\nor clothing, provoked the alleged action of the accused, that she behaved in a manner unbecoming of\\nchaste or 40State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh & Ors., 1996 SCC (2) 384.\\n41 Rachael K. Hinkle et al., A Positive Theory and Empirical Analysis of Strategic Word Choice in\\nDistrict Court Opinions, 4 J. OF LEGAL ANALYSIS 407, 408 (2012).\\n42Ibid, at p. 409.\\n“Indian” women, or that she had called upon the situation by her behavior, etc. These instances are\\nonly illustrations of an attitude which should never enter judicial verdicts or orders or be considered\\nrelevant while making a judicial decision; they cannot be reasons for granting bail or other such\\nrelief. Similarly, imposing conditions that implicitly tend to condone or diminish the harm caused\\nby the accused and have the effect of potentially exposing the survivor to secondary trauma, such as\\nmandating mediation processes in non-compoundable offences, mandating as part of bail\\nconditions, community service (in a manner of speaking with the so-called reformative approach\\ntowards the perpetrator of sexual offence) or requiring tendering of apology once or repeatedly, or in\\nany manner getting or being in touch with the survivor, is especially forbidden. The law does not\\npermit or countenance such conduct, where the survivor can potentially be traumatized many times\\nover or be led into some kind of non-voluntary acceptance, or be compelled by the circumstances to\\naccept and condone behavior what is a serious offence.\\n43. The instances spelt out in the present judgment are only illustrations; the idea is that the\\ngreatest extent of sensitivity is to be displayed in the judicial approach, language and reasoning\\nadopted by the judge. Even a solitary instance of such order or utterance in court, reflects adversely\\non the entire judicial system of the country, undermining the guarantee to fair justice to all, and\\nespecially to victims of sexual violence (of any kind from the most aggravated to the so-called minor\\noffences).\\n44. Having regard to the foregoing discussion, it is hereby directed that henceforth:\\n(a) Bail conditions should not mandate, require or permit contact between the\\naccused and the victim. Such conditions should seek to protect the complainant from\\nany further harassment by the accused;\\n(b) Where circumstances exist for the court to believe that there might be a potential\\nthreat of harassment of the victim, or upon apprehension expressed, after calling for\\nreports from the police, the nature of protection shall be separately considered and\\nappropriate order made, in addition to a direction to the accused not to make any\\ncontact with the victim;Aparna Bhat vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 18 March, 2021\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13024806/ 15(c) In all cases where bail is granted, the complainant should immediately be\\ninformed that the accused has been granted bail and copy of the bail order made over\\nto him/her within two days;\\n(d) Bail conditions and orders should avoid reflecting stereotypical or patriarchal\\nnotions about women and their place in society, and must strictly be in accordance\\nwith the requirements of the Cr. PC. In other words, discussion about the dress,\\nbehavior, or past “conduct” or “morals” of the prosecutrix, should not enter the\\nverdict granting bail;\\n(e) The courts while adjudicating cases involving gender related crimes, should not\\nsuggest or entertain any notions (or encourage any steps) towards compromises\\nbetween the prosecutrix and the accused to get married, suggest or mandate\\nmediation between the accused and the survivor, or any form of compromise as it is\\nbeyond their powers and jurisdiction;\\n(f) Sensitivity should be displayed at all times by judges, who should ensure that\\nthere is no traumatization of the prosecutrix, during the proceedings, or anything\\nsaid during the arguments, and\\n(g) Judges especially should not use any words, spoken or written, that would\\nundermine or shake the confidence of the survivor in the fairness or impartiality of\\nthe court.\\n45. Further, courts should desist from expressing any stereotype opinion, in words spoken during\\nproceedings, or in the course of a judicial order, to the effect that (i) women are physically weak and\\nneed protection; (ii) women are incapable of or cannot take decisions on their own; (iii) men are the\\n“head” of the household and should take all the decisions relating to family; (iv) women should be\\nsubmissive and obedient according to our culture; (v) “good” women are sexually chaste; (vi)\\nmotherhood is the duty and role of every woman, and assumptions to the effect that she wants to be\\na mother; (vii) women should be the ones in charge of their children, their upbringing and care;\\n(viii) being alone at night or wearing certain clothes make women responsible for being attacked;\\n(ix) a woman consuming alcohol, smoking, etc. may justify unwelcome advances by men or “has\\nasked for it”; (x) women are emotional and often overreact or dramatize events, hence it is necessary\\nto corroborate their testimony; (xi) testimonial evidence provided by women who are sexually active\\nmay be suspected when assessing “consent” in sexual offence cases; and (xii) lack of evidence of\\nphysical harm in sexual offence case leads to an inference of consent by the woman.\\n46. As far as the training and sensitization of judges and lawyers, including public prosecutors goes,\\nthis court hereby mandates that a module on gender sensitization be included, as part of the\\nfoundational training of every judge. This module must aim at imparting techniques for judges to be\\nmore sensitive in hearing and deciding cases of sexual assault, and eliminating entrenched social\\nbias, especially misogyny. The module should also emphasize the prominent role that judges are\\nexpected to play in society, as role models and thought leaders, in promoting equality and ensuringAparna Bhat vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 18 March, 2021\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13024806/ 16fairness, safety and security to all women who allege the perpetration of sexual offences against\\nthem. Equally, the use of language and appropriate words and phrases should be emphasized as part\\nof this training.\\n47. The National Judicial Academy is hereby requested to devise, speedily, the necessary inputs\\nwhich have to be made part of the training of young judges, as well as form part of judges’\\ncontinuing education with respect to gender sensitization, with adequate awareness programs\\nregarding stereotyping and unconscious biases that can creep into judicial reasoning. The syllabi\\nand content of such courses shall be framed after necessary consultation with sociologists and\\nteachers in psychology, gender studies or other relevant fields, preferably within three months. The\\ncourse should emphasize upon the relevant factors to be considered, and importantly, what should\\nbe avoided during court hearings and never enter judicial reasoning. Public Prosecutors and\\nStanding Counsel too should undergo mandatory training in this regard. The training program, its\\ncontent and duration shall be developed by the National Judicial Academy, in consultation with\\nState academies. The course should contain topics such as appropriate court-examination and\\nconduct and what is to be avoided.\\n48. Likewise, the Bar Council of India (BCI) should also consult subject experts and circulate a\\npaper for discussion with law faculties and colleges/universities in regard to courses that should be\\ntaught at the undergraduate level, in the LL.B program. The BCI shall also require topics on sexual\\noffences and gender sensitization to be mandatorily included in the syllabus for the All India Bar\\nExamination.\\n49. Before parting, this Court expresses its gratitude for the valuable suggestions and the assistance\\nrendered by the learned Attorney General pursuant to the notice issued. We also appreciate the\\nsubmissions made on behalf of the appellant(s) and the intervenor(s).\\n50. Each High Court should, with the help of relevant experts, formulate a module on judicial\\nsensitivity to sexual offences, to be tested in the Judicial Services Examination.\\n51. In the light of the above, the bail conditions in the impugned judgment, extracted at para 3\\nabove, are set aside, and expunged from the record.\\n52. Before concluding, it would be appropriate to quote certain excerpts from the Canadian\\nCommentaries on Judicial Conduct:43 43 Les Éditions Yvon Blais Inc, 1991, quoted by Rt. Hon’ble\\nBeverley Mclachlin, former Chief Justice of Canada, in her Speech Judging in a Democratic State\\nhttps://www.scc-csc.ca/judges-juges/spe-dis/bm-2004-06-03-eng.aspx#fnb10 “[T]he wisdom\\nrequired of a judge is to recognize, consciously allow for, and perhaps to question, all the baggage of\\npast attitudes and sympathies that fellow citizens are free to carry, untested, to the grave.\\nTrue impartiality does not require that the judge have no sympathies or opinions; it requires that\\nthe judge nevertheless be free to entertain and act upon different points of view with an open mind.”Aparna Bhat vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 18 March, 2021\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13024806/ 1753. Judges play – at all levels – a vital role as teachers and thought leaders. It is their role to be\\nimpartial in words and action, at all times. If they falter, especially in gender related crimes, they\\nimperil fairness and inflict great cruelty in the casual blindness to the despair of the survivors.\\n54.

Appellant herein was convicted and sentenced to death for committing murder of\\nhis wife on or about 28.05.1991 at their residential house situate at 81, Richmond\\nRoad, Bangalore. The deceased was earlier married to one Akbar Khaleeli who was in\\nthe diplomatic service in the Government of India. She had four daughters. The\\ndeceased along with her children in the year 1983 visited the Maharaja of Rampur.\\nThere she was introduced to the appellant. Appellant at the relevant time was\\nassisting the Rampur royal family. In regard to the management of her landed\\nproperties, the deceased sought for his assistance. She had inherited huge properties\\nincluding House No. 81, Richmond Road, Bangalore from her mother. She had\\ninherited some other properties during her marriage. Some litigations in respect of\\nthe said properties had been going on.Swamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 12. Mr. Khaleeli on his assignment as diplomat of Iran went to the said country. The\\ndeceased together with her daughters started living at Bangalore. Appellant came\\nthere. He was also staying in the same house.\\nThe deceased desired for a son and she was made to believe by the appellant that he was capable of\\nblessing her with a son. Akbar Khaleeli and the deceased separated in the year 1985. The deceased\\nthereafter married the appellant on 17.04.1986. They started living together at the said house. She\\nhad executed a General Power of Attorney and a Will in his favour. However, despite her marriage\\nwith the appellant, the deceased was maintaining her relationship with her parents and daughters.\\nMrs. Sabah Khaleeli, second daughter of the deceased (PW-5) had all along been in touch with her.\\n3. It is not in dispute that from 28.05.1991, the deceased was not seen. PW-5 had been trying to\\ncontact her on phone. She was informed by the appellant that the deceased had gone to Hyderabad.\\nIn June 1991, when contacted, she was informed that her mother had gone to Kutch to attend a\\nwedding. A week thereafter it was informed to her that the deceased had been lying low owing to\\nsome income tax problems. She, being exasperated with the said explanations, came down to\\nBangalore. She did not find her mother there. She was told that the deceased being pregnant had\\ngone to United States of America for delivery of the child. She was told to have been admitted in\\nRoosevelt Hospital. She made verifications thereabout through her acquaintances and came to know\\nthat no such woman had ever been admitted to the said hospital. Appellant being confronted\\nthereto, informed her that the deceased had gone to London as she had wanted to keep it as a secret.\\nHowever, in 1992, when she met the accused at Mumbai, noticed the passport of her mother lying in\\nthe room of the hotel which confirmed that the deceased had not visited USA or London as\\nrepresented to her by the appellant on earlier occasions.\\n4. She ultimately informed the Ashok Nagar Police Station by giving a written complaint about\\nmissing of her mother. A missing complaint was registered on 10.06.1992. No serious effort,\\nhowever, was made to find out the whereabouts of the deceased. PW-5 approached the higher\\nauthorities resulting in the investigation of the matter being entrusted to the Central Crime Branch.\\nApprehending arrest, Appellant obtained anticipatory bail with a condition that he would attend the\\npolice between 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. on every Monday and shall also make him available to the police. He\\napplied for relaxation of the said condition and by an order dated 3.12.1993, it was directed that the\\nappellant shall appear before the police authorities on every Monday once in three months.\\n5. The investigation was entrusted to one C. Veeraiaha (PW-37). He suspected the appellant herein.\\nHe was interrogated on 28.03.1994, whereupon he made a voluntary statement which was marked\\nas Ex. P-175. He stated in great details as to the manner in which he had killed his wife and disposed\\nof her dead body. He also disclosed as to how a wooden box of size 2 x 7 x 2 was made, a pit was dug\\nand how the dead body was buried there. He narrated that how with the help of Raju he had put the\\nbox into the pit covered with mud and on the next day with the help of some masons brought by the\\nsaid Raju kadapa stone slabs were put on the pit and the adjacent land and cemented the place.\\n6. In the said statement, he stated:Swamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 2\"If I am taken I will show the place where the wooden box was prepared and the\\nperson who prepared it, the persons who transported the box and the people who\\nhelped in digging out the pit and the crow bar, spade, pan used for digging pit, the\\ncement bags and the spot where Shakerah is buried and I exhume the dead body of\\nthe deceased and show you. The statement what all I had earlier given to Ashoknagar\\nPolice was a false statement given intentionally just to escape myself.\"\\n7. An Executive Magistrate Syed Ejaj Ahmad (PW-3) was called for exhumation of the dead body. He\\nasked a doctor to conduct exhumation proceeding. On 30.03.1994, Dr. Nissar Ahmed (PW-14) came\\nto the place of occurrence for the said purpose. Appellant was asked as to whether he was ready to\\nshow the spot as per his earlier statement. The entire proceeding of exhumation of the dead body\\nwas video-graphed. It took place at about 10.30 a.m. on the said day. Appellant with a chalk piece\\nmarked the spot. Coolies accompanying the party as per instructions of the appellant himself, dug\\nthe earth of the said place whereupon a box was noticed. The plank of the lid of the wooden box was\\nremoved. A bed, a nighty, pillow and bed sheets were recovered. Channaiah who had come along\\nwith Dr. Nissar Ahmed removed the scalp, skull and hairs of the head which were detached from the\\nskull and other bone pieces. He also removed the pieces of the bones. Another Doctor Shri\\nThiruvanakkarasu also came there. They joined the bones and fixed the skull and mandible in\\norderly manner. It was found to be that of a human skeleton. The mother of the deceased Smt.\\nGauhar Taj Namazie identified a ring which was embedded with red stone and two other black rings\\nas belonging to the deceased. The nighty which was recovered was identified to be belonging to the\\ndeceased by the maid servant who had been working in the house.\\n8. The post mortem examination commenced at 4.45 p.m. on 30.03.1994 which ended at about 6\\np.m.\\n9. Appellant was, thereafter, charged for commission of murder of his wife. Before the learned Trial\\nJudge, 39 prosecution witnesses were examined. There was no eye-witness to the occurrence. The\\nprosecution was based on circumstantial evidence.\\n10. The learned Trial Judge, as noticed hereinbefore, found the appellant guilty of commission of\\noffence under Sections 302 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to death.\\n11. Appellant preferred an appeal before the High Court. A reference was also made by the learned\\nJudge in terms of Section 366 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\\n12. The circumstances which were found to be existing by the High Court for proving commission of\\nthe offence are said to be :\\n\"(a) Motive \\x16 Murder for gain\\n(b) The deceased Shakereh was last seen alive in May 1991 when she was residing at\\nNo. 81, Richmond Road, Bangalore along with accused and his wife.Swamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 3(c) Strange conduct of the accused after 28-5-91\\n(d) A wooden box (MO.5) was got prepared and brought to the house by the accused.\\n(e) Discovery of the wooden box containing a skeleton and feminine articles buried in\\nthe backyard of the said house of the accused and the deceased in furtherance of\\ninformation furnished by the accused.\\n(f) Fixing the identity of the skeleton as that of the deceased with the help of skull and\\nthe admitted undisputed photograph of Mrs. Shakereh by photo Super-imposition\\nmethod.\\n(g) Fixing the identity of the skeleton as that of the deceased on the basis of DNA\\nfinger printing.\\n(h) Identifying some of the articles like MOs. 5, 6, 8, 11 to 17 along with the skeleton\\nin the box as belonging to the deceased.\\n(i) The last circumstance put forth i.e., the attempt of the accused to mislead or to\\ngive false explanation.\"\\n13. Before the High Court, a contention was raised that before imposition of sentence, the appellant\\nhad not been granted adequate opportunity to make a representation as was mandatorily required\\nunder Sub-section (2) of Section 235 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The High Court gave\\nthe appellant an opportunity of being heard. Before the High Court, the appellant accepted that he\\nwas instrumental in burying the dead body stating:\\n\"The accused submitted that he is innocent and has been illegally convicted. He\\nsubmitted that as the family members of the deceased (parents and daughters) had\\nfiled number of cases against the deceased, she was mentally depressed and was\\ntaking number of sedative pills/ drugs; that she died naturally in May 1991 and as he\\nfeared adverse consequences, especially repercussions from her family members and\\ncommunity people, he buried her body in the backyard of his house without\\ninforming anybody. He submitted that though this fact was not stated by him in the\\ntrial court, as he could not bear it any more and after thinking over the matter for the\\nlast few years, he has decided to come out with this truth. He submitted that as he is\\ninnocent, his conviction be set aside and he be acquitted. So far as the sentence is\\nconcerned, he submitted that as now he is 61 years old and suffering from serious\\nailments like diabetes, hypertension and hernia and as he is in custody for the last 11\\nyears, mercy be shown to him by reducing the capital punishment, if ever the court\\ndecides to convict him.\"\\n14. The High Court, however, affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence.Swamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 415. Mr. Alok Vagrecha, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant raised the following\\ncontentions in support of this appeal:\\n(i) A First Information Report having been already lodged by PW-5, a second report\\nby the Investigating Officer \\x16 PW-37 lodged on 28.03.1994 (Ex. P-171) was illegal.\\n(ii) The purported recovery of the wooden box containing some articles and the bones which were\\nnot admissible in evidence under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act as the location of the dead\\nbody was already known, the purported statement made by the appellant (Ex. P 175) being wholly\\ninadmissible in evidence, consequent recovery of the dead body would also be inadmissible. In this\\nconnection our attention has been drawn to the fact that the appellant was given an opportunity to\\nhave the services of a lawyer during interrogation.\\n(iii) If the prosecution case is true that the appellant had administered sedative to the deceased on\\n28.05.1991 in the afternoon, the courts below should have also taken into consideration that in view\\nof the statement of the investigating officer that the appellant at about the same time on 28.05.1991\\nwas found to be in the company of one Rekha Handa, a former Miss India, the prosecution case\\nmust be held to have not been proved as against the appellant.\\n(iv) A Will and General Power of Attorney having already been executed by the deceased, the\\nappellant could not have any motive to kill her.\\n(v) The purported circumstances on the basis whereof the judgment of conviction and sentence have\\nbeen rendered does not complete all the links in the chain as there had been (a) no recovery of drug;\\n(b) motive had not been proved; and (c) there was no proof that she died of poisoning.\\n(vi) The purported recovery of drug on 31.03.1994 by the Investigating Officer was wholly\\ninadmissible in evidence.\\n(vii) The High Court having recorded that the deceased did not meet any violent death, the\\nimpugned judgment cannot be sustained and in any event the death sentence should not have been\\nimposed.\\n(viii) The High Court committed a serious illegality in relying upon the statement made by the\\nappellant before it as being confession of his guilt although the same was meant to be used for the\\npurpose of hearing on the question of sentence only.\\n16. Mr. Sanjay R. Hegde, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State, on the other hand,\\nsupported the judgment. The learned counsel would contend that the court while analyzing the\\nevidences brought on records should keep in mind the following facts:\\n(a) The deceased was a beautiful woman. She had a husband and four daughter\\n(b) She was an owner of huge propertySwamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 5(c) She met her death at the age of 40 years.\\n(d) Appellant although could enjoy all the luxuries of life, he had greed for more\\nmoney and, therefore, hatched a plan to murder the deceased wherefor he got\\nprepared a wooden box, took advantage of temporary absence of the two old servants\\nand at the opportune moment administered sedative to the deceased.\\n(f) Despite her death, he had been operating the bank account which was a joint\\naccount and had been acting on the basis of the General Power of Attorney.\\n(g) He kept to PW-5 at dark although she had been constantly making enquiry in\\nregard to the whereabouts of the deceased for one and half years.\\n(h) The manner in which the dead body was found categorically shows the vicious\\nmind of the appellant as the bed-sheet was found on her face, her jewelery was found\\non the top of the body, the deceased had nighty on her person and, thus, it was\\nessentially principally a planned murder.\\n17. We have not doubt that the death of the deceased was homicidal in nature. The identity of the\\ndead body has also been established. The circumstances in which the deceased married the\\nappellant have also not been disputed. Their marriage was proved by PW-8 T.H. Lokeshminarayana.\\nAppellant also did not deny or dispute that he had been living with the deceased at all material times\\nat 81, Richmond Road, Bangalore. It has furthermore not been disputed that she had not been seen\\non and from 28.05.1991.\\n18. We have noticed hereinbefore the circumstances which are said to have been found by the courts\\nbelow. The law in this behalf is now no longer res integra.\\n19. In Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra [AIR 1984 SC 1622], this Court held:\\n\"153. A close analysis of this decision would show that the following conditions must\\nbe fulfilled before a case against an accused can be said to be fully established:\\n(1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be\\nfully established.\\nIt may be noted here that this Court indicated that the circumstances concerned \"must or should\"\\nand not \"may be\" established. There is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between \"may\\nbe proved\" and \"must be or should be proved\" as was held by this Court in Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade\\nv. State of Maharashtra where the observations were made: [SCC para 19, p. 807: SCC (Cri) p. 1047]\\n\"Certainly, it is a primary principle that the accused must be and not merely may be guilty before a\\ncourt can convict and the mental distance between \\'may be\\' and \\'must be\\' is long and divides vague\\nconjectures from sure conclusions.\"Swamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 6(2) the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused,\\nthat is to say, they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is\\nguilty, (3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency, (4) they should exclude\\nevery possible hypothesis except the one to be proved, and (5) there must be a chain of evidence so\\ncomplete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of\\nthe accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the\\naccused.\"\\n20. In regard to the circumstantial evidence in a case of death by poisoning, this Court opined:\\n\"So far as this matter is concerned, in such cases the court must carefully scan the\\nevidence and determine the four important circumstances which alone can justify a\\nconviction:\\n(1) there is a clear motive for an accused to administer poison to the deceased, (2)\\nthat the deceased died of poison said to have been administered, (3) that the accused\\nhad the poison in his possession, (4) that he had an opportunity to administer the\\npoison to the deceased.\"\\n[See also Aloke Nath Dutta & Ors. v. State of West Bengal 2006 (13) SCALE 467]\\n21. We may proceed to consider the matter keeping in view the aforementioned legal principle in\\nmind.\\n22. Dr. Nissar Ahamed who examined himself as PW-14 in his evidence proved the exhumation of\\nthe dead body. It, as noticed hereinbefore, was conducted by the Taluka Magistrate PW-3. Upon\\nremoval of the detached skull, mandible, carpal and tarsal, palm and bones from the pit of feet, all\\nthe said bones were assembled on plastic paper. A Human skeleton was formed. There was a foul\\nsmell. According to him, all the bones were intact. The skeleton was that of a human body. In the\\npost mortem examination, it was found:\\n\"Decomposed and Skeletanised body removed from the wooden box described. The\\nbody was removed in piece meal from the box as the bones were easily coming out\\nfrom the joints and body was assembled in anatomical position which consists of\\nskull with black hair measuring 25\"\\nlong.\"\\nIt was further noticed:\\n\"The bones one below the other are: Skull bone with mandible, two clavicles, two\\nscapulae, bones of upper limbs and lower limbs, vertebral column, pelvis and carple\\nand tarsal bones.

All the internal organs were found to be decomposed and liquefied. He, however, reserved his\\nopinion in regard to the cause of death pending chemical analysis. The doctor preserved skull and\\nmandible for super imposition and visera and hair for chemical analysis report and bone marrow\\nhair and soft tissues for DNA Fingerprinting.\\n24. PW-14 on the basis of the said FSL report formed his opinion that the cause of death cannot be\\nfurnished as the percentage/ amount of Chlodiazepoxide consumed had not been furnished. In\\nregard to the effect of Chlordizaepoxide on human body, however, his opinion was as under:\\n\"The effect of Chlordiazopoxide on human body depends upon the dosage. They are\\nweight gain, as a result of increase appetite, anxiety, nausea, vertigo, impaired sexual\\nfunction, menstrual irregularities, skin rashes, agramlocytosis etc.\"\\nIn regard to the effect of over dose of the said medicine, it was stated:\\n\"Effects of over dose are rare, as the drug has got remarkable safety margins. A few\\ndeaths have been reported at doses greater than 700 mgs as per the literature. The\\nsymptoms are respiratory and cardiovascular, dis-function due to the suppression of\\nhigher centers in the brain.\"\\n25. PW-14 in his cross-examination opined that the death of the deceased was homicidal. According\\nto him, if the deceased had consumed only one or two tablets of Equibrom and her body was put in a\\nbox and lid was closed suddenly, an unexpected death may occur due to natural causes also. It is not\\na case where the dead body was not identified to that of the deceased. Blood sample of PW-5 was\\ntaken. Blood samples of Mirza Gulam Hussain Namazie and Gauhar Taj Begum Namazie had also\\nbeen taken. PW-20 Srimannarayan, Chief Medical Officer of Bowring Hospital, in his evidence,\\nspoke about the result of the DNA analysis in regard to taking of the blood samples.\\n26. The bones were sent for DNA test to Hyderabad Forensic Science Laboratory through Forensic\\nScience Laboratory, Bangalore. The test was conducted by Dr. Laljit Singh, Scientist, who was\\nexamined as PW-24. According to him, he and Dr. G.V. Rao (PW-17), another scientist in\\nHyderabad together carried the process of DNA isolation and testing from Exs.

PW-17 Dr. G.V. Rao categorically stated that in carrying out DNA fingerprinting they followed\\nthe same procedure as in the case of blood samples received earlier which were examined. He\\nproved the report prepared by him and Dr. Laljit Singh on 4.10.1995 which was marked as Ex.\\nP-155.\\n28. PW-1 Dr. T.R. Kumari was an Assistant Director of Forensic Science Laboratory. She gave her\\nopinion on 15.09.1994 which was marked as Ex. P-125 stating:\\n\"1. Presence of Clonazepam was detected in article no. I(a) & I(b).\\n2. Presence of Alprazolam was detected in article No. I(b) & I(f).\\n3. Presence of Diazepam was detected in article No. I(c).\\n4. Presence of Chlodizepoxide was detected in No. I(e), III & IV.\\n5. No poison was detected in article No. I(h).\"\\n29. Dr. T.R. Kumari (PW-1) conducted the Photo Superimposition Method Test on the skull, which\\nwas marked as MO-1 along with the admitted photograph of the deceased, which was marked as\\nMO-3. According to the said witness, anthropometric characters or land marks of the skull and the\\nsuperimposed admitted photographs matched. She prepared a report, which was marked as Ex.P-2.\\nHer qualification as an expert to conduct the said test is not in doubt. Even otherwise, she holds a\\nPh.D. degree in Forensic Science. She has been awarded a medal for her research work by the\\nMadras Forensic Society of India. She has also undergone special training in photo superimposition\\nand has submitted a number of papers thereon. Her report as also the report of PW-17 are relevant\\nevidences.\\n30. The qualification of the expert has not been questioned before us. The learned counsel appearing\\non behalf of the appellant has not raised any contention which would point out that the\\nmethodology conducted by the experts in carrying out the study was in any manner unscientific or\\nraised any suspicion as regards the correctness thereof.\\n31. It is borne out from the records that even the photographs were brought by PW-1 before the trial\\ncourt. Identify of the skull vis-`-vis the other parts of the body, thus, categorically goes to show that\\nthe same was that of the deceased, Smt. Shakereh.\\n32. It has also not been seriously disputed that the deceased was last seen in the company of the\\ncompany of the appellant. The fact that she had not been seen alive from May, 1991 also stands fullySwamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 9established.\\n33. We will hereinafter notice the circumstances which existed in establishing the commission of the\\ncrime.\\n34. PW-5 Sabah Khaleeli, was the daughter of the deceased through her first husband. She in her\\ndeposition categorically stated that she had spoken to her mother on 19.04.1991. She was not\\navailable on phone from May, 1991 onwards. Gauhar Namazee (PW-25) was the mother of the\\ndeceased. She in her deposition stated that she had last seen the deceased on 13.04.1991. She had\\nnot been cross-examined on the said point. It is also not disputed that PW-18 and PW-19, who were\\nhusband and wife, were engaged by the deceased. They saw the deceased in the company of the\\nappellant in the morning of 28.05.1991, for the last time. The said witnesses were staying in a\\nservant quarter in the said premises. PW-18 was working as gardener-cum-handyman; whereas\\nPW-19 was working as maid servant, since 1988. They stated in unison that they had seen the\\ndeceased at about 07.30 A.M. on that day. According to PW-19, she went to the kitchen to prepare\\ntea for the couple and kept the tea cups on the dining table. She in no uncertain terms stated that the\\ncups of tea were taken by the appellant to the bed-room where the deceased was reading a\\nnewspaper. PW-19 while sweeping the house was called by the deceased and was instructed to clean\\nthe articles kept in the showcase instead of sweeping. They, however, received a telegram at about\\n10.00 a.m. whereby they were informed that the sister-in-law of PW-19 was sick at Gudisuvarapally\\nin the State of Andhra Pradesh. They sought for leave and some money. They were permitted to\\nleave Bangalore and were asked to collect the requisite amount after some time. They came back to\\ntheir quarters and started packing their goods. At about 1.30 p.m. they went back to the house.\\nPW-18, however, was said to have been asked by the appellant herein to shift a wooden box kept in\\nthe guest house to the bed room before leaving. They together with some others took a large wooden\\nbox from the guest house and kept the same inside the bed room, where they found the deceased\\nsleeping on the bed. They were thereafter paid a sum of Rs.1,200/- towards their salary and\\nadditional sum of Rs.500/- towards travelling expenses. They left for their home. They came back\\nafter a couple of days, but did not find the deceased. The said two witnesses in their depositions\\ncorroborated each other.\\n35. We have noticed hereinbefore that the appellant had applied for grant of anticipatory bail in\\nJuly, 1992 i.e. after the missing complaint was filed by PW-5. In the said application for bail, the\\nappellant himself disclosed that the deceased had left for unknown destination in the month of May,\\n1991, allegedly because of her agitated mental condition.\\n36. If it is proved that the deceased died in an unnatural circumstance in her bed room, which was\\noccupied only by her and her husband, law requires the husband to offer an explanation in this\\nbehalf. We, however, do not intend to lay down a general law in this behalf as much would depend\\nupon the facts and circumstances of each case. Absence of any explanation by the husband would\\nlead to an inference which would lead to a circumstance against the accused.\\n37. We may, however, notice that recently in Raj Kumar Prasad Tamarkar v. State of Bihar & Anr.\\n[2007 (1) SCALE 19 : JT 2007 (1) SC 239], this Court opined :Swamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 10\"Once the prosecution has been able to show that at the relevant time, the room and\\nterrace were in exclusive occupation of the couple, the burden of proof lay upon the\\nrespondent to show under what circumstances death was caused to his wife. The\\nonus was on him. He failed to discharge the same.\"\\nThis legal position would appear from a decision of this court in Nika Ram v. The State of Himachal\\nPradesh [AIR 1972 SC 2077] wherein it was held:\\n\"It is in the evidence of Girju PW that only the accused and Churi deceased resided in\\nthe house of the accused. To similar effect are the statements of Mani Ram (PW 8),\\nwho is the uncle of the accused, and Bhagat Ram school teacher (PW 16). According\\nto Bhagat Ram, he saw the accused and the deceased together at their house on the\\nday of occurrence. Mani Ram (PW 8) saw the accused at his house at 3 p.m., while\\nPoshu Ram, (PW 7) saw the accused and the deceased at their house on the evening\\nof the day of occurrence. The accused also does not deny that he was with the\\ndeceased at his house on the day of occurrence. The house of the accused, according\\nto plan PM, consists of one residential room one other small room and a varandah.\\nThe correctness of that plan is proved by A. R. Verma overseer (PW 5). The fact that\\nthe accused alone was with Churi deceased in the house when she was murdered\\nthere with the Khokhri and the fact that the relations of the accused with the\\ndeceased, as would be shown hereafter, were strained would, in the absence of any\\ncogent explanation by him, point to his guilt.\"\\nIn Trimukh Maroti Kirkan v. State of Maharashtra [JT 2006 (9) SC 50], the law is stated in the\\nfollowing terms:\\n\"Where an accused is alleged to have committed the murder of his wife and the\\nprosecution succeeds in leading evidence to show that shortly before the commission\\nof crime they were seen together or the offence took place in the dwelling home\\nwhere the husband also normally resided, it has been consistently held that if the\\naccused does not offer any explanation how the wife received injuries or offers an\\nexplanation which is found to be false, it is a strong circumstance which indicates\\nthat he is responsible for commission of the crime\\x05\"\\n38. We have noticed hereinbefore as to why the investigation was taken over by the Central Crime\\nBranch. As the interrogation of the appellant, while in custody of the police, revealed the possibility\\nof the deceased having been buried in the backyard of her residential house, the Investigating\\nOfficer requested the Sub-Divisional Magistrate to conduct exhumation proceedings, who in turn,\\nauthorized the Taluka Executive Magistrate (PW-3) to do so. Confession of the accused was not\\nadmissible in evidence. What was admissible only was that part of the confession leading to the\\ndiscovery of fact in terms of Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act. The proceedings were conducted\\nin the presence of the accused, which were videographed and marked as MO-18. The learned Trial\\nJudge as also the learned Judges of the High Court had the benefit of watching the said videograph.\\nThe High Court in its impugned judgment recorded :Swamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 11\"The videograph and the inquest proceeding disclose that a large wooden box was\\nfound buried in the backyard of the house of the accused and the deceased and\\ncontained a skeleton. The videograph recording which is not disputed by the accused,\\nclearly discloses and shows that it was the accused who was pointing out the exact\\nspot to be dug up in the big backyard and in fact marked the area with a chalk. The\\nvideograph further showed that the backyard flooring was of well laid Cuddapah\\nstones property cemented. In such a situation, in our view, nobody except the person\\nwho buried the box could have the knowledge of its burial.\"\\n39. Discovery of the last remains of the deceased was a relevant fact, which was, thus, admissible in\\nevidence. Appellant had pinpointed the exact place which was to be dug up. He marked the exact\\narea. He also made an oral statement that the box was buried beneath the area so marked, location\\nwhereof showed that it was a big area, flooring of which had been well plastered with cement having\\nCuddapah stone slabs. The video showed that the slabs had been laid there much earlier and were\\nnot of recent origin.\\n40. In Aloke Nath Dutta (supra), in regard to applicability of Section 26 and Section 27 of the Indian\\nEvidence Act, it was stated :\\n\"The policy underlying behind Sections 25 and 26 is to make it a substantive rule of\\nlaw that confessions whenever and wherever made to the police, or while in the\\ncustody of the police to any person whomsoever unless made in the immediate\\npresence of a magistrate, shall be presumed to have been obtained under the\\ncircumstances mentioned in Section 24 and, therefore, inadmissible, except so far as\\nis provided by Section 27 of the Act.\"\\n41. Pulukuri Kottayya v. King Emperor [AIR 1947 PC 67] is an authority for the proposition that\\n\"fact discovered\" envisaged under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, embraces the place\\nfrom which the object was produced, the knowledge of the accused as to it, but the information\\ngiven in that behalf must relate distinctly to that effect, stating :\\n\"The condition necessary to bring the section into operation is that discovery of a fact\\nin consequence of information received from a person accused of any offence in the\\ncustody of a Police Officer must be deposed to, and thereupon so much of the\\ninformation as related distinctly to the fact thereby discovered may be proved.\"\\nIt was further observed :\\n\"In their Lordships\\' view it is fallacious to treat the \"fact discovered\" within the\\nsection as equivalent to the object produced; the fact discovered embraces the place\\nfrom which the object is produced and the knowledge of the accused as to this, and\\nthe information given must relate distinctly to this fact.\"Swamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 12\"Information supplied by a person in custody that \"I will produce a knife concealed in\\nthe roof of my house\" does not lead to the discovery of a knife, knives were discovered\\nmany years ago. It leads to the discovery of the fact that a knife is concealed in the\\nhouse of the informant to his knowledge, and if the knife is proved to have been used\\nin the commission of the offence, the fact discovered is very relevant.\"\\n42. An attempt was made by the Bombay High Court to take a different view in Shri Shankar Gopal\\nPatil & Others v. The State of Maharashtra [2000 (5) Bom. CR 360].\\n43. The legal proposition propounded in Pullukuri Kottaya (supra) has been considered by this\\nCourt in Jaffar Hussain Dastagir v. State of Maharashtra [(1969) 2 SCC 872], Shamshuk Kanwar v.\\nState of U.P. [(1995) 4 SCC 430] and State of Maharasthra v. Damu [(2000) 6 SCC 269], wherein\\nthis Court reiterated it with approval.\\n44. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, in our opinion, was not correct to\\ncontend that only because the investigating team having regard to the purported confession made by\\nthe appellant had already known that a dead body had been buried in the house, Section 27 of the\\nEvidence Act would not be attracted. In his statements before the investigating officer, he made a\\nconfession; but what was admissible in evidence his only that part which would come within the\\npurview of Section 27 of the Evidence Act and not the rest. The court while analyzing the evidence\\nand appreciating the same cannot take note of confession made before the police.\\n45. The prosecution case must rest on the other materials brought before the court. It is also not\\npermissible to start with the confession and find corroborative evidence thereof and come back to\\nthe confession again for the purpose of arriving at a conclusion of guilt.\\n46. What was, therefore, relevant for the purpose of Section 27 of the Evidence Act was that at the\\ninstance of the appellant himself a particular place which had been pin pointed by him had been dug\\nand remains of a body and other articles were recovered.\\n47. The various circumstances leading to the pointing out the guilt of the appellant and appellant\\nalone have been enumerated by us hereinbefore. From our discussions, it is evident that each of the\\ncircumstances had been established, the cumulative effect whereof would show that all the links in\\nthe chain are complete and the conclusion of the guilt is fully established.\\n48. We are not oblivious of the fact that there is a material difference distance between \\'may be\\' and\\n\\'must be\\' and furthermore in a case of this nature the evidence must be considered with more than\\nordinary care lest the shocking nature of crime induce an instinctive reaction against a dispassionate\\njudicial scrutiny of the facts and law. [See Kashmira Singh v. State of Madhya Pradesh - AIR 1952 SC\\n159].\\n49. The question, however, is as to whether in a case of this nature death sentence should be\\nimposed. In Aloke Nath Dutta (supra), this Court had an occasion to consider a large number of\\ndecisions taking different views in regard to the interpretation of the words \"rarest of rare cases\" asSwamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 13adumbrated in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab [(1980) 2 SCC 684].\\n50. This Court had also the occasion therein to notice the growing demand in the international fora\\nand in particular the second Optional Protocol to the International Covenants on Civil and Political\\nRights and the Protocol to the American Constitution on Human Rights abolished that death\\npenalty should be abolished.\\n51. Recently, the Privy Council in Reyes v. R. [(2002) UKPC 11 : 12 BHRC 219] and Hughes, R. v.\\n(Saint Lucia) [(2002) UKPC 12], noticing the decision of this Court in Mithu v. State of Punjab\\n[(1983) 2 SCR 6903], opined that the mandatory death punishment is unconstitutional. [See also\\nFox v. The Queen (2002) 2 AC 284, Bowe v. The Queen (2006) 1 WLR 1623 and Coard & Ors. v. The\\nAttorney General (Grenada), (2007) UKPC 7].\\n52. Abolition of death penalty is not being and, in fact, cannot be advocated; but what requires\\nserious consideration is as to whether the jurisdiction should not be invoked unless there exists an\\nextra-ordinary situation to find that it comes within the purview of \"rarest of rare\" cases. The\\napproach of the courts should not be to confine its thought process to the identification of a \"rare\"\\ncase. The expression \"rarest of rare\" case has been evolved by a Constitution Bench of this Court\\nand, thus, demands a meaningful application.\\n53. It is interesting to note that Bhagwati, J. in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab [(1982) 3 SCC 24],\\nwhile expressing his dissenting opinion, noticed as under :\\n\"\\x05This arbitrariness in the imposition of death penalty is considerably accentuated by\\nthe fragmented Bench structure of our courts where Benches are inevitably formed\\nwith different permutations and combinations from time to time and cases relating to\\nthe offence of murder come up for hearing sometimes before one Bench, sometimes\\nbefore another sometimes before a third and so on. Professor Blackshield has in his\\narticle on Capital Punishment in India published in Volume 21 ot the Journal of the\\nIndian Law Institute\\x06 pointed out how the practice of Bench formation contributes to\\narbitrariness in the imposition of death penalty. It is well known that so far as the\\nSupreme Court is concerned, while the number of Judges has increased over the\\nyears, the number of Judges on Benches which hear capital punishment cases has\\nactually decreased. Most cases are now heard by two-Judge Benches. Professor\\nBlackshield has abstracted 70 cases in which the Supreme Court had to choose\\nbetween life and death while sentencing an accused for the offence of murder and\\nanalysing these 70 cases he has pointed out that during the period April 28, 1972 to\\nMarch 8, 1976 only 11 Judges of the Supreme Court participated in 10 per cent or\\nmore of the cases. He has listed these 11 Judges in an ascending order of leniency\\nbased on the proportion for each Judge of plus votes (i.e. votes for the death\\nsentence) to total votes and pointed out that these statistics show how the judicial\\nresponse to the question of life and death varies from judge to judge. It is significant\\nto note that out of 70 cases analysed by Professor Blackshield, 37 related to the\\nperiod subsequent to the coming into force of Section 354, sub-section (3) of theSwamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 14Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. If a similar exercise is performed with reference to\\ncases decided by the Supreme Court after March 8, 1976, that being the date up to\\nwhich the survey carried out by Professor Blackshield was limited, the analysis will\\nreveal the same pattern of incoherence and arbitrariness, the decision to kill or not to\\nkill being guided to a large extent by the composition of the Bench. Take for example\\nRajendra Prasad case decided on February 9, 1979. In this case, the death sentence\\nimposed on Rajendra Prasad was commuted to life imprisonment by a majority\\nconsisting of Krishna Iyer, J. and Desai, J., A.P. Sen, J. dissented and was of the view\\nthat the death sentence should be confirmed. Similarly in one of the cases before us,\\nnamely, Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, when it was first heard by a Bench\\nconsisting of Kailasam and Sarkaria, JJ., Kailasam, J. was definitely of the view that\\nthe majority decision in Rajendra Prasad case9 was wrong and that is why he referred\\nthat case to the Constitution Bench. So also in Dalbir Singh v. State of Punjab, the\\nmajority consisting of Krishna Iyer, J. and Desai, J. took the view that the death\\nsentence imposed on Dalbir Singh should be commuted to life imprisonment while\\nA.P. Sen, J. stuck to the original view taken by him in Rajendra Prasad case9 and was\\ninclined to confirm the death sentence, It will thus be seen that the exercise of\\ndiscretion whether to inflict death penalty or not depends to a considerable extent on\\nthe value system and social philosophy of the Judges constituting the Bench\\x05\"\\n54. We are not oblivious of a line of decisions of this Court where the doctrine of proportionality has\\nbeen applied, even in the matter of awarding death penalty. [See State of Rajasthan v. Kheraj Ram,\\n(2003) 8 SCC 224, Bablu @ Mubarik Hussain v. State of Rajasthan, 2006 (14) SCALE 15 and Shivu\\nand Anr. v. R.G. High Court of Karnataka and Anr. 2007 (3) SCALE 157]\\n55. In this case we need not go into the correctness or otherwise of the said view. Although it is also\\nnot necessary to do so, we may notice some development of law in this regard.\\n56. Criminal Justice Act 1991 of England famously hailed doctrine of proportionality as the guiding\\nprinciple. But since the 1991 legislation, field of sentencing has seen much reform and Criminal\\nJustice Act of 2003 presents a fresh set of sentencing objectives. Section 142 of the Act delineates\\nthe following as the purposes of sentencing:\\n\"142 Purposes of sentencing (1) Any court dealing with an offender in respect of his\\noffence must have regard to the following purposes of sentencing-\\n(a) the punishment of offenders,\\n(b) the reduction of crime (including its reduction by deterrence),\\n(c) the reform and rehabilitation of offenders,\\n(d) the protection of the public, andSwamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 15(e) the making of reparation by offenders to persons affected by their offences.\"\\n57. In this context it, a reference should also be made of the Halliday Report of 2001 (Making\\nPuncishments Work) which has some interesting insights to offer on the sentencing structure in\\nEngland and Wales. In the same vein, a White Paper in 2002 has made a case of reforms and\\nsuggested a shift from the proportionality principle.\\n58. In fine, scholarship on sentencing which has been quite diverse in its prescriptions certainly has\\nconsensus on the point that any decision on sentencing aspect would require assessing more than\\none variables and single minded pursuit of any one sentencing ideal would be discounting on other\\nequally urgent parameters and objectives.\\n59. We do not have a sentencing policy, unlike some other countries. England has the concept of\\n\"guideline judgments\" which is considered as a judge managed sentencing model rather than a\\nstatute induced one. Section 354 (3) suggests that Indian law furthers statute induced sentencing\\nguidance in part. Therefore it has to be given full colour.\\n60. We have no practice of referring such matters to superior courts for laying down the guidelines\\nrelating to imposition of sentence under various situations. [See The Queen v. Julie McGinley and\\nMichael Monaghan, (2003) NICC 1]\\n61. In our country, therefore, each case may have to be considered on its own merit.\\n62. It may be of some interest to note that Furman v. Georgia [408 U.S. 238 (1972)] ruled on the\\nrequirement for a degree of consistency in the application of the death penalty.\\nJustice Stewart held that:\\n\"The penalty of death differs from all other forms of criminal punishment, not in\\ndegree, but in kind. It is unique in its total irrevocability. It is unique in its rejection\\nof rehabilitation of the convict as a basic purpose of criminal justice. And it is unique,\\nfinally, in its absolute renunciation of all that is embodied in our concept of\\nhumanity.\\n*** *** *** These death sentences are cruel and unusual in the same way that being\\nstruck by lightning is cruel and unusual. For, of all the people convicted of rapes and\\nmurders in 1967 and 1968, many just as reprehensible as these, the petitioners are\\namong a capriciously selected random handful upon whom the sentence of death has\\nin fact been imposed.\"\\n63. Justice Brennan while interpreting Eighth Amendment (Amendment VIII: (Excessive bail shall\\nnot be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted) of US\\nConstitution observes in Furman:Swamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 16\"In determining whether a punishment comports with human dignity, we are aided\\nalso by a second principle inherent in the Clause -- that the State must not arbitrarily\\ninflict a severe punishment. This principle derives from the notion that the State does\\nnot respect human dignity when, without reason, it inflicts upon some people a\\nsevere punishment that it does not inflict upon others. Indeed, the very words \"cruel\\nand unusual punishments\" imply condemnation of the arbitrary infliction of severe\\npunishments.\"\\n64. It is important to refer to Harbans Singh v. Union of India [AIR 1982 SC 849] at this juncture. In\\nthat case three people were sentenced to death by the trial court for playing an equal part in jointly\\nmurdering a family of four persons. The sentence of all the three was confirmed by the High Court.\\nEach of them moved to the Supreme Court by different Special Leave Petitions before three separate\\nbenches. One of the accused\\'s petition was dismissed and he was actually executed. Another\\'s\\npetition was allowed and his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. And the petition\\nof the third one was also dismissed. He filed a review petition, which was also dismissed, and the\\nExecutive refused clemency. He then moved another petition before the Supreme Court bringing to\\nlight this arbitrariness. The Supreme Court recommended the President to commute his sentence.\\nChandrachud J. while lamenting the death of dead accused said:\\n\"The fate of Jeeta Singh has a posthumous moral to tell. He cannot profit by the\\ndirection which we propose to give because he is now beyond the process of human\\ntribunals.\"\\n65. Bentham\\'s discourse on determination of minimum punishment and maximum punishment\\nserves as a yardstick in this context. Bentham in his landmark treatise Principles of Penal Law\\npropose to establish a proportion between crimes and punishments. But he cautions against an\\noracular understanding than an instructive one. We here further go in the details of what doctrine of\\nproportionality holds in the realm of sentencing. The first rule of proportionality mandates:\\n\"The value of the punishment must not be less in any case than what is sufficient to\\noutweigh that of the profit of the offence.\"\\nWhile talking of minimum punishment Bentham observes:\\n\"Punishments may be too small or too great; and there are reasons for not making\\nthem too small, as well as not making them too great. The terms minimum and\\nmaximum may serve to mark the two extremes of this question, which require equal\\nattention.\\nWith a view of marking out the limits of punishment on the side of the first of these\\nextremes, we may lay it down as a rule:\\x17 That the value of the punishment must not\\nbe less in any case than what is sufficient to outweigh that of the profit of the offence.Swamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 17By the profit of the crime, must be understood not only pecuniary profit, but every\\nadvantage real or apparent, which has operated as a motive to the commission of the\\ncrime.\"\\n66. It is to be appreciated here that statutorily decided minimum sentence takes into account the\\nbasic value of the crime and suffice to outweigh the profit of the offence. The moot question relates\\nto parameters to decide the maximum punishment. Setting the trail of caution on the side of\\ndetermination of maximum punishment Bentham posits:\\n\"Punishment, whatever shape it may assume, is an evil...\\nThe minimum of punishment is more clearly marked than its maximum. What is too\\nlittle is more clearly observed than what is too much. What is not sufficient is easily\\nseen, but it is not possible so exactly to distinguish an excess. An approximation only\\ncan be attained. The irregularities in the force of temptations, compel the legislator to\\nincrease his punishments till they are not merely sufficient to restrain the ordinary\\ndesires of men; but also the violence of their desires when unusually excited.\\nThe greatest danger lies in an error on the minimum side, because in this case the\\npunishment is inefficacious; but this error is least likely to occur, a slight degree of\\nattention sufficing for its escape; and when it does exist, it is at the same time clear\\nand manifest, and easy to be remedied. An error on the maximum side, on the\\ncontrary, is that to which legislators and men in general are naturally\\ninclined\\x17antipathy, or a want of compassion for individuals who are represented as\\ndangerous and vile, pushes them onward to an undue severity. It is on this side\\ntherefore, that we should take the most preparations, as on this side there has been\\nshown the greatest disposition to err.\"\\n67. On the same point Beccaria in his historic work Of Crimes and Punishments denounced\\nretributive basis of punishment.\\n\"The aim of punishment can only be to prevent the criminal committing new crimes\\nagainst his countrymen, and to keep others from doing likewise. Punishments,\\ntherefore, and the method of inflicting them, should be chosen in due proportion to\\nthe crime so as to make the most efficacious and lasting impression on the minds of\\nmen, and the least painful impressions on the body of the criminal.\\nFor a punishment to be efficacious, it is enough that the disadvantage of the\\npunishment should exceed the advantage anticipated from the crime; in which excess\\nshould be calculate the certainty of punishment and the loss of the expected benefit.\\nEverything beyond this, accordingly, is superfluous, and therefore tyrannical.\"\\n68. There is a clear and discernible necessity of caution to set the maximum punishment in an\\noffence. And also by implication there must be intensive and exhaustive inquiry into accused relatedSwamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 18parameters before employing the maximum sentence by a court of law. Therefore discretion to the\\njudiciary in this respect (to declare the maximum punishment) is of utmost critical and seminal\\nvalue. Reasons must be detailed setting clearly why any punishment other than the maximum\\npunishment will not suffice. This is a general and age-old rule of sentencing which has been\\nstatutorily recognized under section 354(3).\\n69. Reference to the decision of other jurisdictions and/or the recent trend in the international fora\\nhas not been referred to by way of precedents or even a persuasive value but the court in this age\\ncannot afford to put down blinkers on its window to the outside world.\\n70. It is noteworthy to mention here the Law Commission in its Report of 1967 took the view that\\ncapital punishment acted as a deterrent to crime. While it conceded that statistics did not prove\\nthese so-called deterrent effects. It also said that figures did not disprove them either.\\n71. Tracing the judicial view on Death Penalty, one can start with the Jagmohan Singh case (1973)\\nwhere it agreed with the Law Commission that capital punishment should be retained. But\\nsubsequent cases such as those of Ediga Anamma (1974) and Rajendra Prasad (1979) saw dissenting\\nvoices being raised in this court. These led to a hearing of the Bachan Singh (1980) case by a\\nConstitutional Bench.\\n72. In Rajendra Prasad v. State of U.P. [(1979) 3 SCR 646], it was held that the special reasons\\nnecessary for imposing a death penalty must relate not to the crime but to the criminal. It could be\\nawarded only if the security of the state and society, public order in the interest of the general public\\ncompelled that course.\\n73. The death penalty was abolished in 1965 in the U.K. Member-states of the European Union\\ncannot have the death penalty. In Canada, after the abolition of the death penalty in 1976, the\\nhomicide rate declined. In 2000, there were 542 homicides in Canada \\x17 16 fewer than in 1998 and\\n159 fewer than in 1975 (one year prior to the abolition of capital punishment). In 1997, the\\nAttorney-General of Massachusetts said: \"there is not a shred of credible evidence that the death\\npenalty lowers the murder rate. In fact, without the death penalty the murder rate in Massachusetts\\nis about half the national average.\"\\n74. The South African Constitutional Court unanimously ruled in 1995 that the death penalty for\\nmurder violated the country\\'s Constitution. More than 118 countries have abolished the death\\npenalty either in law or practice. The second optional protocol to the International Civil Covenant,\\nwhich came into force in 1991, mandates the abolition of the death penalty.\\n75. Whatever may be the \"merits\", \"demerits\" or \"criticism\", one cannot hope for unjustness in\\nsociety. Deterring or preventive theory may not have any application at all in respect of imposition\\nof death sentence. The law itself mandates that for imposing death sentence, special reasons are to\\nbe assigned. Imposition of death punishment is an exception in terms of sub- section (3) of Section\\n354 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Whereas for commission of other offences, one or other\\ntheory, justly or otherwise may be taken recourse to, a large number of factors are required to beSwamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 19borne in mind for awarding death penalty.\\n76. In Renuka Bai alias Rinku alias Ratan and Another v. State of Maharashtra [(2006) 7 SCC 442],\\nBalakrishnan, J. (as the learned Chief Justice then was) while imposing a death sentence in a case\\nwhere the appellants had kidnapped seven children and committed their murder in a most dastardly\\nmanner also noticed:\\n\"36\\x05We have carefully considered the whole aspect of the case and are also alive to\\nthe new trends in the sentencing system in criminology\\x05\"\\n(Emphasis supplied)\\n77. Similarly in Bhimashya and Ors. v. Smt. Janabi @ Janawwa [2006 (14) SCALE 27], Dr. Pasayat,\\nJ. took into consideration the overall global view imparting death penalty.\\n78. This new trend, thus, must be taken into consideration only for awarding appropriate\\npunishment.\\n79. We may also note that in Ram Singh v. Sonia & Ors. [2007 (3) SCALE 106] imposition of a death\\npenalty has been upheld in the case where the accused had not only put an end to the life of her step\\nbrother and his whole family which included three tiny tots of 45 days, 2 \\x16 = years and 4 years but\\nalso her own father, mother and sister in a very diabolic manner so as to deprive her father from\\ngiving the property to her step brother and his family. It was, in the aforementioned extraordinary\\nsituation, held:\\n\"\\x05The fact that murders in question were committed in such a diabolic manner while\\nthe victims were sleeping, without any provocation whatsoever from the victims\\' side\\nindicates the cold-blooded and premeditated approach of the accused to cause death\\nof the victims. The brutality of the act is amplified by the grotesque and revolting\\nmanner in which the helpless victims have been murdered which is indicative of the\\nfact that the act was diabolic of most superlative degree in conception and cruel in\\nexecution and that both the accused persons are not possessed of the basic\\nhumanness and completely lack the psyche or mind set which can be amenable for\\nany reformation\\x05\"\\n(Emphasis supplies)\\n80. Yet again, another Division Bench of this Court in Shivu (supra) has upheld the death penalty\\nwhere the accused was charged with Sections 302 and 376 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal\\nCode. In that case, the repeated attempts were made by two accused aged 20 and 22 years to commit\\nrape on Lakkamma, daughter of one Puttegowda (PW-7). They were caught but only had been\\nadmonished. Yet again, they attempted to commit rape on PW-10 who was the daughter of\\nJayamma (PW-1). The accused persons, however, escaped any punishment even then at the instance\\nof village elders and their family members and instead Panchayat of village elders was called on eachSwamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 20occasion and accused were directed to mend their ways. The court found that emboldened by the\\nescapes from punishment in those two incidents, the accused committed rape on the deceased a\\nyoung girl of hardly 18 years and to avoid detection committed heinous and brutal act of her\\nmurder.\\n81. It would, therefore, appear that cases where death penalty is upheld are those where murder was\\ncommitted of a large number of persons or by more than one person in a brutal or systematic\\nmanner.\\n82. Bhagwati, J. in his dissenting opinion in Bachan Singh (supra) pointed out one; Aloke Nath\\nDutta (supra) has also pointed out other instances.\\n83. With utmost respect, I am of the opinion that the doctrine of proportionality which is often\\nreferred to in the judicial pronouncements in regard to the sentencing policy required to be\\njudicially adopted should not apply in a case of imposition of capital punishment. Precedent should\\nnot be contrary to Parliamentary law; far less the decision of a Constitution bench of this Court\\n84. We may, however, notice that the question in regard to the death penalty again came up for\\nconsideration before this Court in Acharaparambath Pradeepan & Anr. v. State of Kerala [2006 (13)\\nSCALE 600] and Bishnu Prasad Sinha and Anr. v. State of Assam [2007 (2) SCALE 42] wherein\\nAloke Nath Dutta (supra) was reiterated.\\n85. In Bishnu Prasad Sinha (supra), it was observed :\\n\"The question which remains is as to what punishment should be awarded.\\nOrdinarily, this Court, having regard to the nature of the offence, would not have\\ndiffered with the opinion of the learned Sessions Judge as also the High Court in this\\nbehalf, but it must be borne in mind that the appellants are convicted only on the\\nbasis of the circumstantial evidence. There are authorities for the proposition that if\\nthe evidence is proved by circumstantial evidence, ordinarily, death penalty would\\nnot be awarded. Moreover, the appellant No.1 showed his remorse and repentance\\neven in his statement under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He\\naccepted his guilt.\"\\n(See also Amarjit Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR 2006 SCW 5712)\\n86. We may, however, hasten to add that no universal rule is meant to be laid down as even in\\nBishnu Prasad Sinha (supra), the word \"ordinarily\" has been used. There may be cases and cases\\nwhere even on circumstantial evidence, a death penalty may be imposed.\\n87. In Sahdeo & Ors. vs. State of U.P. [(2004) 10 SCC 682], this Court opined :\\n\"As regards the sentence of death imposed on five accused persons by the sessions\\ncourt, which was confirmed by the appellate court, the counsel for the appellants,Swamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 21Shri Sushil Kumar submitted that in the absence of clear and convincing evidence\\nregarding the complicity of the accused, these appellants could not be visited with the\\ndeath penalty, while the counsel for the State submitted that this is a ghastly incident\\nin which eight persons were done to death and the death penalty alone is the most\\nappropriate punishment to be imposed. Though it is proved that there was an\\nunlawful assembly and the common object of that unlawful assembly was to kill the\\ndeceased persons, there is another aspect of the matter inasmuch as there is no clear\\nevidence by the use of whose fire-arm all the six deceased persons died as a result of\\nfiring in the bus. It is also pertinent to note that the investigating agency failed to\\nproduce clear and distinct evidence to prove the actual overt acts of each of the\\naccused. The failure to examine the driver and conductor of the bus, the failure to\\nseize the bus and the absence of a proper \\'mahzar\\', are all lapses on the part of\\ninvestigating agency. Moreover, the doctor who gave evidence before the court was\\nnot properly cross-examined regarding the nature of the injuries. Some more details\\ncould have been collected as to how the incident might have happened inside the bus.\\nThese facts are pointed out to show that the firing may have been caused by the\\nassailants even while they were still standing on the footboard of the bus and some of\\nthe appellants may not, in fact, have had an occasion to use the fire-arm, though they\\nfully shared the common object of the unlawful assembly. Imposition of the death\\npenalty on each of the five appellants may not be justified under such circumstances.\\nWe take this view in view of the peculiar circumstances of the case and it should not\\nbe understood to mean that the accused persons are not to be convicted under\\nSection 302 read with Section 149 and the death penalty cannot be imposed in the\\nabsence of various overt acts by individual accused persons. In view of the nature and\\ncircumstances of the case, we commute the death sentence imposed on A-1 Sahdeo,\\nA-4 Subhash, A-5 Chandraveer, A-7 Satyapal and A-10 Parvinder to imprisonment\\nfor life.\"\\n88. In Raju vs. State of Haryana [(2001) 9 SCC 50], it has been opined by this Court :\\n\"However, the next question is whether this would be a rarest of rare cases where\\nextreme punishment of death is required to be imposed. In the present case, from the\\nconfessional statement made by the accused, it would appear that there was no\\nintention on the part of the accused to commit the murder of the deceased child. He\\ncaused injury to the deceased by giving two brick blows as she stated that she would\\ndisclose the incident at her house. It is true that learned Sessions Judge committed\\nerror in recording the evidence of SI Shakuntala, PW 15 with regard to the\\nconfessional statement made to her, but in any set of circumstances, the evidence on\\nrecord discloses that the accused was not having an intention to commit the murder\\nof the girl who accompanied him. On the spur of the moment without there being any\\npremeditation, he gave two brick blows which caused her death. There is nothing on\\nrecord to indicate that the appellant was having any criminal record nor can he be\\nsaid to be a grave danger to the society at large. In these circumstances, it would be\\ndifficult to hold that the case of the appellant would be rarest of rare case justifyingSwamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 22imposition of death penalty.\"\\n89. It has been a fundamental point in numerous studies in the field of Death Penalty jurisprudence\\nthat cases where the sole basis of conviction is circumstantial evidence, have far greater chances of\\nturning out to be wrongful convictions, later on, in comparison to ones which are based on fitter\\nsources of proof. Convictions based on seemingly conclusive circumstantial evidence should not be\\npresumed as full proof incidences and the fact that the same are circumstantial evidence based must\\nbe a definite factor at the sentencing stage deliberations, considering that capital punishment is\\nunique in its total irrevocability. Any characteristic of trial, such as conviction solely resting on\\ncircumstantial evidence, which contributes to the uncertainty in the culpability calculus, must\\nattract negative attention while deciding maximum penalty for murder.\\n90. One of the older cases in this league dates back to 1874, Merritt v. State, 52 Ga. 82, 85 (1874)\\nwhere the Supreme Court of Georgia described the applicable law in Georgia as follows:\\n\"By the penal code of this state the punishment of murder shall be death, except\\nwhen the conviction is founded solely on circumstantial testimony. When the\\nconviction is had solely on circumstantial testimony, then it is discretionary with the\\npresiding judge to impose the death penalty or to sentence the defendant to\\nimprisonment in the penitentiary for life, unless the jury . . . shall recommend that\\nthe defendant be imprisoned in the penitentiary for life; in that case the presiding\\njudge has no discretion, but is bound to commute the punishment from death to\\nimprisonment for life in the penitentiary.\"\\n91. Later case of Jackson v. State, 74 Ala. 26, 29-30 (1883) followed the aforementioned case. [Also\\nsee S.M. Phillipps, Famous Cases of Circumstantial Evidence with an Introduction on the Theory of\\nPresumptive Proof 50-52 (1875)]\\n92. In United States v. Quinones, 205 F. Supp. 2d 256, 267 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) the court remarked:\\n\"Many states that allow the death penalty permit a conviction based solely on\\ncircumstantial evidence only if such evidence excludes to a moral certainty every\\nother reasonable inference except guilt.\"\\n93. In the instant case, confession before police was taken as a gospel truth. It seems that the\\njudicial mind has a role to play in that behalf in imposition of sentence.\\n94. Another aspect which needs to be considered as according to the Bachan Singh Rule (that\\nsentencing should involve analysis about the nature of crime as well as the accused) which require\\nconsideration, is the effect of two pointers relating to the nature of crime. Firstly, the case does not\\nseem to be an instance of what is called a diabolical murder. We come across cases of murdering\\nwife by burning for non-fulfillment of dowry, preceded by continuous torture. Simon and Ors. v.\\nState of Karnataka [(2004) 2 SCC 694] noting the \"all murders are cruel\" observation in Bachan\\nSingh (supra) puts the law on death penalty in perspective as:Swamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 23\"The Constitution Bench said that though all murders are cruel but cruelty may vary\\nin its degree of culpability and it is only then the culpability assumes the proportion\\nof extreme depravity that \"special reasons\" can legitimately be said to exist.\"\\n95. Second point relates to planning which went into committing the murder. It is agreed that\\naccused deliberately came close to the beautiful and wealthy lady. He must have had his intentions\\nand calculations in that regard. To that extent intention behind the marriage can be imputed. But to\\ninfer from that the murder was a pre-planned murder will be going a bit too far as he did not know\\nthe opportune date when the servant would be leaving the house. He could not have known the\\nservants would receive a telegram and ask for leave. Without their leaving the place, the plan, if\\nthere was any, could not have been executed. This is one weak link in the hypothesis that the murder\\nwas meticulously planned.\\n96. In Kashmir Singh v. State of Himachal Pradesh, [1990 Supp (1) SCC 133] the Court held:\\n\"There was no infirmity in appraisal of the facts and circumstances and the\\ncircumstantial evidence by the courts below in arriving at the conclusion that the\\naccused-appellant has committed the crime under Section 302 IPC. But considering\\nthe fact that it was not a pre-meditated and cold-blooded murder, and also because\\nthe appellant appeared before the Sessions Judge and made a confessional statement,\\nthe sentence is converted from death to life imprisonment.\"\\n97. Keeping the abovementioned other characteristics of the crime, we now delve into whether this\\ninstance can be categorized as a \"rarest of rare\"\\nmurder. The question is whether murder of wife for the purpose of usurping property\\nis a rarest of rare crime statistically. It is not to say that rarest of rare doctrine only\\nhas a statistical dimension i.e. incidence of particular type of murder in a given\\nsample; rarest of rare benchmark can also be used in the context of other parameters\\nsuch a brutality, planning, society\\'s reaction et al. Facets relating to nature of the\\ncrime have already been explained in terms of the few parameters mentioned just\\nnow. Therefore we attend to the incidence aspect. It can not be conclusively said that\\nmurder of wife for usurping property is a particularly rarest of rare incident. It could,\\nof course, be a rare incident.\\n98. Also it is to be realized that in criminal cases character of accused is immaterial by the mandate\\nof section 53 and 54 of Indian Evidence Act. The same should not factor in the discussions at the\\nsentencing stage. If that be so, bad character of the accused by itself should not be a determinative\\nfactor.\\n99. In fact, Appellant should not have been heard at that stage. The stage of hearing an accused\\nunder Section 235(2) of the Code is after the judgment of conviction is pronounced and not prior\\nthereto. Appellant herein made a confession before the High Court. The High Court took the same\\ninto consideration in the main judgment which could not be done. He had been brought before theSwamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar ... vs State Of Karnataka on 18 May, 2007\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/604676/ 24High Court only for purpose of fulfilling the requirement of sub-section (2) of Section 235 of the\\nCode of Criminal Procedure. His Statement was taken during midst of hearing. He knew the\\nimplications thereof. Despite the same, he made a categorical statement that he was responsible for\\nburring the dead body. He gave an explanation, which might not have found favour with the High\\nCourt, but the fact that he had made a confession at least accepting a part of the offence could not\\nhave been ignored at least for the purpose of imposition of punishment. He is more than 64 years\\'\\nold. He is in custody for a period of 16 years. The death sentence was awarded to him by the trial\\ncourt in terms of its judgment dated 20.05.2005. In a situation of this nature, we are of the opinion\\nthat imposition of a life imprisonment for commission of the crime under Section 302 shall serve\\nthe ends of justice.\\n100. However, while saying so, we direct that in a case of this nature \\'life sentence\\' must be meant to\\nbe \\'life sentence\\'. Such a direction can be given, as would appear from some precedents. {See\\nSubhash Chander v. Krishan Lal and Ors. [(2001) 4 SCC 458]}.\\n101. Yet again in Ram Anup Singh and Ors. v. State of Bihar [(2002) 6 SCC 686], this Court directed\\nthat the accused shall remain in jail for a period of not less than 20 years. [See Prakash Dhawal\\nKhairnar (Patil) v. State of Maharashtra, (2002) 2 SCC 35], Shri Bhagwan v. State of Rajasthan\\n[(2001) 6 SCC 296] and Mohd. Munna etc. v. Union of India & Ors. etc. [(2005) 7 SCC 417].\\n102. However, before parting with this case, we may notice that a prayer was made by Smt. Sabhah\\nKhaleeli (daughter of the deceased) that the mortal remains of Smt. Shakereh (deceased) including\\nskull are required by the family of the deceased for burial and obsequies ceremony. The High Court\\nhas issued such a direction. As the family of the deceased and in particular Smt. Sabah Khaleeli\\n(PW-5) desires to perform burial and other obsequies ceremonies, we direct that the order of the\\nHigh Court, in this behalf, may be implemented, as expeditiously as possible.\\n103.
